        "description": "COMPOSITION:\r\r\nEach 1 ml contains:\r\r\n- Flunixin (as meglumine) 50 mg\r\r\n\r\r\nPROPERTIES:\r\r\nNon-steroidal antiinflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic for use in horses, cattle, pigs and dogs.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGY:\r\r\n- Flunixin meglumine is a non-steroidal antinflammalory agent with analgesic and antipyretic activity. Flunixin, through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, blocks synthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins. thromboxane, and prostacycline (PGI2) which are chemical mediators of inflammation. Of the NSAIDs, flunixin is considered to be the most potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor. In contrast to other NSAIDs, therapeutic pharmacological effects are associated with relatively low plasma levels of flunixin. It is reported to be a more potent analgesic than meclofenamic acid, phenylbutazone, naproxen, salicylic acid, pentazocine lactate, pethidine hydrochloride, and codeine phosphate, and to provide comparable analgesia to clinically effective doses of morphine. Analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of flunixin are dose-related and tolerance, as occurs with narcotic agents, apparently does not develop to the action of flunixin.\r\r\n- Clinical studies have confirmed the analgesic and antiinflammatory efficacy of flunixin in the therapy of musculoskeletal disorders in horses and dogs and of colic in horses. In equine colic models flunixin analgesia has been found superior to that of pethidine. Flunixin does not significantly alter gastrointestinal motility, blood pressure, or cardiac rhythm in horses.\r\r\n- Thromboxane and prostacyclin are involved in the adverse haemodynamic changes associated with endotoxic shock. Flunixin administration decreases endotoxin-induced lactic acidosis, reduces severity of arterial hypotension and endothelial cell injury, and improves venous return. Flunixin treatment of dogs with experimental E-coli septicaemia prevents arterial hypotension and hypoxaemia and has resulted in improved animal survival.\r\r\n- Vascular changes in uveitis may be mediated at least in part by endogenous prostaglandin release, and a cause and effect relationship between prostaglandin release and subsequent increase in aqueous protein concentration has been established. Administration of flunixin prior to intraocular surgery is effective in reducing aqueous humour prostacyclin accumulation in the horse. Intravenous flunixin, alone or in combination with a corticosteroid, has been shown to reduce aqueous flare in dogs after intraocular surgery.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETICS:\r\r\n- Flunixin has a rapid onset and long duration of action. Therapeutic effects are manifest within 2 hours after parenteral or oral administration.\r\r\n- Peak response is reached between 12 - 16 hours after administraion, and duration of action is up to 36 hours. The plasma half-life is reported to be 1.6 hours in horses, 3.7 hours in dogs, and 8.1 hours in cattle.\r\r\n- Flunixin is widely distributed throughout body tissues and fluids. Renal excretion is significant in the elimination of flunixin, which is excreted in the urine largely in conjugated form. Excretion via bile and other gastrointestinal secretions may also occur. Flunixin is detectable, by conventional analytical methods, in equine urine for at least 72 hours after dosing and may be detectable by some techniques for up to 15 days after administration.\r\r\n- Drug clearance time after sequential doses does not differ significantly from that following a single dose.\r\r\n- Flunixin apparently does not accumulate in body tissues. NSAIDs however, being acidic, have a propensity to accumulate at sites of low pH such as at regions of inflammation. In experimental models of acute inflammation in horses, concentrations of flunixin in inflammatory exudate have been found to be higher than those in plasma by 6 hours after intravenous administration of a single therapeutic dose. Flunixin suppresses the production of PGE2 in inflammatory exudates for 12-24 hours after a single intravenous dose.\r\r\n- The long pharmacological action of flunixin is at variance with its short plasma half-life in the horse. This may be attributable to the capacity of NSAIDs to irreversibly bind to cyclooxygenase, the accumulation of flunixin at inflammatory sites, and the prolonged excretion of the agent from the body.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS:\r\r\nCLINICAL APPLICATION\r\r\n- Flunix provides effective antiinflammatory and analgesic action in a wide range of musculoskeletal disorders in horses, dogs, cattle and pigs, In those species it may be used in the therapy of arthritis, myositis, and traumatic injuries resulting in fractures and contusions.\r\r\n- Flunix administration results in effective visceral analgesia in cases of equine colic due to flatulence or inflammatory causes. Flunixin is considered to be a more potent analgesic than many of the narcotic or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and is widely used in the therapy of equine colic.\r\r\n- Intravenous administration of flunixin has been advocated in the therapy of ocular antiinflammatory conditions, and may be employed pre and post-operatively to reduce inflammation resulting from intraocular surgery in the horse and dog.\r\r\n- Flunix™ may be a useful alternative, or adjunct, to corticosteroids in such cases.\r\r\n- Flunixin nay be administered subconjunctivally prior to intraocular surgery in the horse to reduce aqueous humour prostacyclin accumulation.\r\r\n- Flunix has been used successfully to reduce the adverse haemodynamic changes which characterise endotoxic shock in both horses and dogs. The agent is also recommended as an adjunct to the therapy of Mastitis-Metritis-Agalactia (MMA) syndrome in sows. Therapeutic effects in such cases are observed at, or below, antiinflammatory dose rates of flunixin.\r\r\n- In cattle, Flunix is used for its antiinflammatory and analgesic actions in the therapy of aseptic laminitis and peripheral nerve injury resulting from direct trauma or pressure. Flunixin administered intravenously at 1.1 mg/kg daily has also been recommended as an adjunct to the treatment of persistent hyperthermia.\r\r\n- Flunix may be administered either intravenously or intramuscularly with comparable efficacy and onset and duration of action. Flunixin has a long pharmacological action, and therapeutic effects are maintained even at low plasma concentrations.\r\r\n- Flunixin has a wide margin of safety and reports of adverse reactions are rare at therapeutic dose rates and recommended treatment durations. Intravenous administration of flunixin at up to 5 times the recommended dose and for twice the recommended treatment period have been reported to produce no gross clinical abnormalities and no changes in haematological, biochemical or urinary parameters. Parenteral administration of the agent rarely causes tissue irritation.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES:\r\r\nHorses, Cattle, Pigs and Dog\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\n- Horses: 1.1 mg / kg (1 mL / 45 kg) bodyweight daily for up to 5 days, by intravenous or intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- Cattle: 2.2 mg / kg (2 mL / 45 kg) bodyweight daily for 3 to 5 days, by intravenous injection.\r\r\n- Pigs: 2.2 mg / kg (2 mL / 45 kg) bodyweight by deep intramuscular injection in the anterior half of the neck. Repeat after 12 hours if required.\r\r\n- Dogs: 1.1 mg / kg (0.2 mL / 10 kg) bodyweight daily for up to 3 days, by intravenous injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING AND PRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n- Use with caution in animals with pre-existing gastrointestinal ulceration, renal, hepatic or haematological disorders.\r\r\n- Prostaglandins have a cytoprotective action on the gastric mucosa, and in some species maintenance of renal blood flow hypovolaemic states is prostaglandin dependent. Flunixin should therefore be used with caution in conjunction with ulcerogenic or nephrotoxic agents, in cases of pre-existing gastrointestinal ulceration or renal disease, and in hypovolaemic patients. Care should be exercised in the use of flunixin in patients with hepatic disease, haematological disorders or severe cardiac failure.\r\r\n- As with other NSAIDs, flunixin should be used cautiously in conjunction with highly protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin, valproic acid, oral anti-coagulants, other anti-inflammatory agents, and sulfonamides.\r\r\n- A case of flunixin toxicity has been reported in a pony mare after intravenous administration of flunixin at greater than 5 times the recommended dose for 5 days. Clinical signs observed included anorexia, depression, gastrointestinal ulceration, hypoproteinaemia and neutropaenia. In dogs treated with flunixin at excessive doses or for prolonged periods, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastrointestinal ulceration may occur.\r\r\n- Flunixin, when used in the therapy of equine colic, may mask the behavioural and cardio-pulmonary signs associated with endotoxaemia or intestinal devitalisation.\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection of flunixin as it may cause transient CNS stimulation, ataxia, hyper-ventilation and muscle weakness.\r\r\n- Flunixin may be slightly irritant when administered by intramuscular injection to young animals, or if injected too superficially into older animals.\r\r\n- Safety of the use of flunixin during pregnancy has not been established.\r\r\n\r\r\nHANDLING PRECAUTIONS:\r\r\nHarmful if swallowed. Wash thoroughly after handling. Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

In cases of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid skin and eye contact. In cases of skin contact, rinse immediately and thoroughly with water as GnRH analogues can be absorbed through the skin. In cases of accidental contact with eyes, rinse thoroughly with plenty of water.\r\r\n- People with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to GnRH analogues should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions: None\r\r\n\r\r\nUse during pregnancy, lactation or lay\r\r\n- Laboratory studies in rats and rabbits have not produced any evidence of a teratogenic or embryotoxic effects.\r\r\n- Observations in pregnant cows receiving the product in early pregnancy have not shown evidence of negative effects on bovine embryos.\r\r\n- Inadvertent administration to a pregnant animal is unlikely to result in adverse effects.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteraction: None known\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration\r\r\n- For Intramuscular use.\r\r\n- 100 μg of gonadorelin (as diacetate) per animal in a single injection (i.e. 2 ml of the product per animal).\r\r\n- Judgement on the protocol to be used should be made by the veterinarian responsible for treatment, on the basis of the treatment objectives of the individual herd or cow. The following protocols have been evaluated and could be used:\r\r\n\r\r\n1- Induction and synchronisation of oestrus and ovulation in combination with a prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) or analogue:\r\r\n• Day 0: First injection of gonadorelin (2 ml of the product)\r\r\n• Day 7: Injection of prostaglandin (PGF2 α) or analogue\r\r\n• Day 9: Second injection of gonadorelin (2 ml of the product) should be done.\r\r\n- The animal should be inseminated within 16-20 hours after the last injection of the product or at observed oestrus if sooner.\r\r\n\r\r\n2- Induction and synchronisation of oestrus and ovulation in combination with a prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) or analogue and a progesterone releasing intravaginal device:\r\r\n- The following FTAI protocols have been commonly reported in the literature:\r\r\n• Insert progesterone releasing intravaginal device for 7 days.\r\r\n• Inject gonadorelin (2 ml of the product) at the progesterone device insertion.\r\r\n• Inject a prostaglandin (PGF2 α) or analogue 24 hours prior to device removal\r\r\n• FTAI 56 hours after removal of the device, or\r\r\n• Inject gonadorelin (2 ml of the product) 36 hours after progesterone releasing intravaginal device removal and FTAI 16 to 20 hours later.\r\r\n\r\r\n3- Treatment of delayed ovulation (repeat-breeding):\r\r\n• GnRH is injected during oestrus.\r\r\n• To improve the pregnancy rates, the following timing of injection and insemination should be followed:\r\r\n- injection should be performed between 4 and 10 hours after oestrus detection\r\r\n- an interval of at least 2 hours between the injection of GnRH and artificial insemination is recommended.\r\r\n- artificial insemination should be carried out in accordance with the usual field recommendations, i.e., 12 to 24 hours after oestrus detection.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nAfter single administration of up to 5 times recommended dose or one to three daily administrations of recommended dose, no measurable signs of either local or general clinical intolerance are observed.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal periods\r\r\n- Meat and offal: zero days\r\r\n- Milk: zero hours\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Gonadotropin-releasing hormones\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Gonadorelin (as diacetate) is a synthetic hormone physiologically and chemically identical to the Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) synthesized in mammalian species.\r\r\n- Gonadorelin stimulates the synthesis and release of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Its action is mediated by a specific plasma membrane receptor. Only 20% GnRH receptor occupancy is required to induce 80% of the maximum biological response. The binding of GnRH to its receptor activates protein kinase C (PKC) and also mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades which provide an important link for the transmission of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus allowing synthesis of the gonadotropin hormones.\r\r\n- In repeat breeding animals, one of the most prominent findings is the delayed and smaller preovulatory LH surge leading to delayed ovulation. Injection of GnRH during oestrus increases the spontaneous LH peak and prevents delay in ovulation in repeat breeding animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n- Absorption: After intramuscular administration of 100 μg of gonadorelin (as diacetate) to the animal, absorption of GnRH is rapid. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of 120.0 ± 34.2 ng / litre is obtained after 15 min (Tmax). Concentrations of GnRH decreased rapidly in plasma. The absolute bioavailability of gonadorelin (IM versus IV) was estimated to be around 89%.\r\r\n- Distribution: 24 hours after intramuscular administration of 100μg of radiolabelled gonadorelin (as\r\r\ndiacetate), the greatest amounts of radioactivity in tissues were measured in the main\r\r\norgans of excretion: liver, kidney and lungs. 8 or 24 hours after the administration, gonadorelin shows an extensive plasma protein binding of 73%.\r\r\n- Metabolism: Gonadorelin is a naturally occurring peptide which is rapidly broken down into inactive metabolites.\r\r\n- Elimination: After intramuscular administration of gonadorelin to the dairy cow, the principal excretion route is milk followed by urine and faeces. A high percentage of the administered dose is excreted as carbon dioxide in expired air.\r\r\n\r\r\nMajor incompatibilities\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage precautions\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Keep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\r\r\n\r\r\nNature of packaging\r\r\n- Material of the primary container\r\r\n- Colourless glass vial type I (4 ml).\r\r\n- Colourless glass vial type II (10, 20 and 50 ml).\r\r\n- Chlorobutyl stopper.\r\r\n\r\r\nPack sizes\r\r\n- Box containing 1 glass vial of 4 ml\r\r\n- Box containing 1 glass vial of 10 ml\r\r\n- Box containing 1 glass vial of 20 ml\r\r\n- Box containing 1 glass vial of 50 ml\r\r\n* Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDisposal precautions\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.",

It is also effective, at the recommended dose rate, against adult and larval infestations of Haemonchus contortus in cattle and sheep and Haemonchus placei, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Bunostomum phlebotomum in cattle. However, HEPANIL 34 should not be regarded or used as a broad spectrum anthelmintic.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\n- By subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n- The standard dosage is 10 mg nitroxynil per kg bodyweight, i.e. 1.5 ml of HEPANIL per 50 kg bodyweight for the treatment of fascioliasis and certain roundworm infestations.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep: In case of an outbreak of fascioliasis, each sheep in the flock should be injected immediately the presence of the disease is recognized, repeating treatment as necessary throughout the period when infestation is occurring, at intervals of not less than one month. On farms with fluke-infested pastures, routine preventative dosing should be carried out at intervals of not less than one month, having regard for such factors as the past disease history of the farm, the frequency and severity of neighbouring outbreaks, and regional forecasts of incidence.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle: Both infected and in-contact animals should be treated, treatment being repeated as considered necessary, though not more frequently than once per month. The treatment of cattle helps to reduce contamination of pastures on farms where fascioliasis is endemic or certain roundworm occurrence is evident. Dairy cows should be treated at drying of (at least 15 days before calving).\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS ETC:\r\r\n• For animal treatment only.\r\r\n• No systemic ill-effects are to be expected when animals (including pregnant cows and ewes) are treated at normal dosage. The very infrequent deaths which have occurred with such dosage have been in sheep treated in advanced stages of liver fluke disease.\r\r\n• Ewes in advanced pregnancy should be driven, handled and dosed carefully.\r\r\n• In the event of accidental overdosage, dextrose saline solution should be administered intravenously. Keep the animal cool (applications of cold water may also be of value).\r\r\n• Small swellings are occasionally observed at the injection site in cattle. These can be avoided by injecting the dose in two separate sites and massaging well, to disperse the solution.\r\r\n• HEPANIL 34 stains and care should be taken not to spill it, especially onto the fleece of sheep.\r\r\n• Wash splashes from skin and eyes immediately.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS:\r\r\n• HEPANIL 34 should not be administered to lactating cows Whose milk is for human consumption.\r\r\n• Animals may not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment or within 60 days from last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n• Check expiry date on pack before use.\r\r\n• HEPANIL 34 should not be mixed with any other preparation.\r\r\n• HEPANIL 34 should be stored in the original container.\r\r\n• Protect from light.\r\r\n• Keep out of the reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE QUANTITIES:\r\r\nMulti-dose plastic containers of 100 ml and 250 ml.",

It is significantly more potent than pentazocine, meperidine, and codeine as an analgesic in the rat yeast paw test. Flunixin is four times as potent on a mg per mg basis as phenylbutazone as measured by the reduction in lameness and swelling in the horse plasma half-life in horse serum is 1.6 hours following a single dose of 11 mg/kg. Measurable amounts are detectable in horse plasma at 8 hours post injection. In the bovine, FINADYNE has been shown to be an effective antipyretic agent in acute inflammatory conditions. Plasma half-life in bovine serum after a single 0.25 mg/kg intramuscular dose is 0.3 hours. After the recommended intravenous dose in calves flunixin plasma levels peaked at 10 minutes (14.9 mcg/ml) and decreased to less than 01 mcg/ml at 24 hours post injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n➡️ Horse: \r\r\n- For the alleviation of inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders.\r\r\n- For the alleviation of visceral pain associated with colic.\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Cattle:\r\r\n1. For the control of acute inflammation associated with respiratory disease.\r\r\n2. Finadyne has also been shown to have some benefit in the treatment of experimental acute bovine pulmonary emphysema (Fog Fever).\r\r\n3. Finadyne Solution may be used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of acute mastitis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n➡️ Horses:\r\r\n- The recommended dose for musculoskeletal disorders is 1.1 mg per kg (1 ml/45 kg) of body weight once daily. treatmet may be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection and repeated for up to five days. Studies show onset of activity is within 2 hours. Peak response occurs between 12 and 16 hours and duration of activity is 24-36 hours.\r\r\n- The recommended dose for the alleviation of pain assoclated with equine colic is 1.1 mg per kg of body weight. Intravenous administration is recommmended for prompt releif. Clinical studies show pain is alleviated in less than 15 minutes in many cases.\r\r\n- Treatment may be repeated when signs of colic recur. During clinical studies approximately 10% Of the horses requred one or two additional treatments. The cause o e colic should be determined and treated wih concomitant therapy\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Cattle: The recommended dose is 2.2 mg / kg (2 ml/45 kg) for the antipyretic effect in acute inflamnmatory conditions in cattle. Intravenous administration is recommended. the cause of the acute inflammatory condition should be determined and appropriate concomitant therapy initiated.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nThere are no known contraindications to this drug when used as directed. Intra-arterial injection should be avoided in cattle and horses. Horses inadvertently injected intra-arterially can show adverse reactions. Signs can be ataxia, incoordination, hyperventilation, hysteria and muscle weakness. Signs are transient and disappear without antidotal medication within a few minutes.\r\r\n1. Do not exceed the stated dose or the duration of treatment.\r\r\n2.

Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\nThe effect of FlNADYNE on pregnancy has not been determined. No effects were noted in laboratory animals. Studies to determine activity of FINADYNE when administered concomitantly with other drugs have not been conducted. Drug compatibility should be monitored closely in animals requiring adjunctive therapy. Don't mix FlNADYNE with other medications prior to injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\nDuring clinical studies no significant side effects were reported.\r\r\n\r\r\nTOXICITY\r\r\n➡️ Horses: toxicity studies were conducted in horses. A three-fold intramuscular dose of 3.3 mg per kg body weight daily for 10 consecutive days was safe. No changes were observed in hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis values. Intravenous dosages of 1.1 mg/kg daily for 15 days; 3.3 mg/kg daily for 10 days and 5.5 mg/kg daily for five days produced no changes in blood or urine parameters. No injection site irritation was observed following intramuscular injection of the 1.1 mg/kg recommended dose. Some irritation was observed following a 3-fold dose administered intramuscularly.\r\r\n➡️ Cattle: toxicity parameters were evaluated in heifers injected intravenously with 2.2 mg/kg or 6.6 mg/kg once daily for five consecutive days. No toxic manifestations were observed for either dose during the study.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\n1. Overdosage studies in the target species have shown the product to be well-tolerated.\r\r\n2.

        "description": "Synulox (R.T.U.) READY-TO-USE SUSPENSION FOR INJECTION clavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRODUCT SUMMARY\r\r\n• NOVEL FORMULATION: dual action of clavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin.\r\r\n• EXTENDED SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY: clavulanate extends the spectrum of amoxycillin by making it active against resistant (B-lactamase-producing) strains of staphylococci, E. coli, salmonellae and Campylobacter species. Furthermore Klebsiella species are added to the range of susceptible organisms.\r\r\n• KILLS BACTERIA RAPIDLY: increases the likelihood or a rapid clinical cure.\r\r\n• EXCELLENT ABSORPTION AND PENETRATION: ensures suticiently high levels of Synulox at the common infection sites to achieve clinical success.\r\r\n• HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: the novel formulation of Synulox increases the high cure rates achieved with amoxycillin alone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\r\nSynulox Ready-To-Use Injection is an off-white suspension containing 35 mg / ml clavulanic acid as Potassium clavulanate Ph. Eur. and 140 mg / ml amoxycillin as Amoxycillin trihydrate Ph. Eur.\r\r\n\r\r\nUSES\r\r\n• Synulox Ready-To-Use Injection has a notably broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against the bacteria commonly found in cattle, and small animals.\r\r\n• MODE OF ACTION: Resistance to many antibiotics is caused by B-lactamase enzymes which destroy the antibiotic before it can act on the bacteria themselves. The clavulanate in Synulox counter-acts this defence mechanism by inactivating the B-lactamases, thus rendering the bacteria sensitive to amoxycilin's rapid bactericidal effect at concentrations readily attainable in the body.\r\r\na) In vitro Synulox is active against a wide range of clinically important bacteria including: Gram-positive: Staphylococci (including B-lactamase producing strains), Streptococci, Corynebacteria, Clostridia, Bacillus anthracis, Actinomyces bovis, Peptostrepto-coccus spp. Gram-negative Escherichia coli (including B-lactamase producing strains), Salmonellae (including B-lactamase producing strains), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter spp., Klebsiellae, Proteus spp., Pasteurellae, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides (including 8-lactamase producing strains, Haemophilus spp., Moraxella spp., Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Actinobacillus lignieresi.\r\r\n\r\r\nb) Indications:\r\r\n» Cattle: respiratory infections, soft tissue infections (eg joint-ill, abscesses etc) metritis and mastitis.\r\r\n» Dogs and cats: respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections (eg abscesses, pyoderma, anal sacculitis, gingivitis).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Cattle, dogs and cats: 8.75 mg / kg bodyweight, equivalent to 1 ml of suspension per 20 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- Treatment should be administered once daily for 3 to 5 days.\r\r\n- Shake the vial to suspend the active material. Inject by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route for dogs and cats and by intramuscular route only for cattle then massage the injection site.\r\r\n- The suspension is not suitable for intravenous or intrathecal administration. Great care should be taken to avoid contaminating the remaining contents of the vial with water (see Pharmaceutical Precautions)\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS ETC\r\r\n- For animal treatment only.\r\r\n- In common with all other penicillins, Synulox should not be used orally or parenterally in rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters or gerbils. Caution is advised in its use in any other very small herbivores. Use of the product may occasionally result in pain on infection and/or local tissue reaction.\r\r\n\r\r\nOPERATOR WARNINGS\r\r\n- Penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact, Hypersensitivity to penicillins lead to cross-reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa, Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.\r\r\n- Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised, or if you have been advised not to work such preparations.\r\r\n- Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions.\r\r\n- If you develop symptoms following such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning. Swelling of face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing, are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\n- Milk for human consumption must not be taken during treatment. Milk for human consumption may be taken from cattle at 60 hours (5th milking, if cows are milked twice daily).\r\r\n- Animals must not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment, Cattle may be slaughter for human consumption only after 14 days from the last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store below 25 °C. Keep out of reach of children.\r\r\n- Shake the vial well before use. Swab the septum before removing each dose. USE A COMPLETELY DRY STERILE NEEDLE AND SYRINGE. This product does not contain antimicrobial preservative. Following withdrawal of the first dose, use the product within 28 days.\r\r\n- Clavulanic acid is moisture sensitive. It is very important, therefore, that a COMPLETELY DRY SYRINGE is used when extracting suspension for injection in order to avoid contaminating the remaining contents of the vial with drops of water. Contamination will result in obvious beads of dark brown discolouration corresponding to the introduced water droplets. Material affected in this way should not be used as it may have significantly reduced potency.\r\r\n- Discard of any unused product or containers in accordance with guidance from your local waste regulation authority, eg the local regional office of the Environment Agency or SEPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING QUANTITIES\r\r\nSynulox Ready-To-Use Injection is available in polystyrene outers containing 12 x 40 ml and 6 x 100 ml vials.\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- Synulox is a novel concept in antibiotic therapy.\r\r\n- Resistance to many antibiotics is caused by B-lactamase enzymes which destroy the antibiotic before it can act on the bacteria themselves. The clavulanate in Synulox counter-acts this defence mechanism by inactivating the B-lactamases, thus rendering the bacteria sensitive to amoxycillin's rapid bactericidal effect, at concentrations readily attainable in the body.\r\r\n- Synulox is effective against Klebsiella infections found in veterinary practice, but it is not indicated for cases involving Pseudomonas species.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by Haupt Pharma for Zoetis Italy",

An increase in the incidence of osteoporosis may be noted, especially in older dogs, with prolonged use of these drugs. Corticosteroids have been associated with an increased incidence of cleft palate and other congenital malformations. In addition, their use may be associated with the induction of the first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\nCorticosteroids may mask signs of infection, such as elevation in body temperature.Their use during the healing phase of bone fracture is not recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nDrug interactions:\r\r\nGlucocorticoids may decrease the efficacy of bacteriostatic antibiotics by decreasing the inflammatory response and diminishing the pathocytic activity of leukocytes.Amphotericin B, furosemide, and the thiazide diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia .Hypokalemia may predispose to digitalis toxicity. Glucocorticoids may reduce serum salicylate levels. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin may increase the metabolism of glucocorticoids, and insulin requirements of diabetic patients may Increase. The concomitant use of glucocorticoids and cyclosporine may lead to increases in serum levels of both drugs. The dose of steroids used in animals receiving mitotane may have to be increased.

The maximum number of broachings should be limited to 20.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 21 days\r\r\n- Milk: Zero hours\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not store above 30°C.\r\r\n- Keep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\r\r\n- Once broached, use within 28 days.\r\r\n- When the container is broached (opened) for the first time, using the in-use shelf-life which is specified on this package leaflet, the date on which any product remaining in the carton should be discarded should be worked out. This discard date should be written in the space provided.\r\r\n- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n- Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.\r\r\n- Do not exceed the stated dose or the duration of treatment.\r\r\n- Do not administer other NSAID's concurrently or within 24 hours of each other.\r\r\n- As NSAID therapy can be accompanied by gastrointestinal or renal impairment, adjunctive fluid therapy should be considered especially in the case of acute mastitis treatment.\r\r\n- In common with other NSAIDs, carprofen should not be administered simultaneously with another veterinary medicinal product of the NSAID or glucocorticoid class.\r\r\n- NSAID's are highly bound to plasma proteins and may compete with other highly bound drugs, such that concomitant administration may result in toxic effects.\r\r\n- However during clinical studies in cattle four different antibiotic classes were used, macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins and potentiated penicillins without known interactions.\r\r\n- In clinical studies, no adverse signs were reported after intravenous and subcutaneous administration of up to 5 times the recommended dose.\r\r\n- There is no specific antidote for carprofen overdosage but general supportive therapy, as applied to clinical overdosage with NSAID's, should be applied.\r\r\n- Carprofen, in common with other NSAIDs, has been shown to exhibit photosensitising potential in laboratory studies. Avoid skin contact with the product. Should this occur, wash the affected areas immediately.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed or in accordance with local/national requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nOTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- For animal treatment only.\r\r\n- Rimadyl Cattle is available in cardboard box containing one multidose amber glass (Type I) vial of either 50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml capped with bromobutyl rubber stopper retained by an aluminum crimped seal.\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor any information about this veterinary medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder.",

Inside the cell it binds irreversibly to receptors on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome where it interferes with the binding of the aminoacyl-transfer RNA to the acceptor site on the messenger RNA ribosome complex. This effectively prevents the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, inhibiting protein synthesis. The product is specifically formulated to provide a prolonged action resulting in sustained antibacterial activity.\r\r\n- Oxytetracycline has a broad spectrum of activity, i.e. active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Oxytetracycline has been shown to be effective in vitro against the following bacterial species: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Escherichia coli, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella dublin, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus uberis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n- Blood levels persist for at least 4 days after administration by the intramuscular route. Maximum blood levels are achieved between 4 and 8 hours following intramuscular administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle, sheep and pigs\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications for use\r\r\n- Atrophic rhinitis caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.\r\r\n- Navel/joint ill caused by Trueperella pyogenes, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus.\r\r\n- Mastits caused by Corynebacterium pyogenes, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus uberis.\r\r\n- Metritis caused by E. coli or Streptococcus pyogenes.\r\r\n- Pasteurellosis and infections of the respiratory tract caused by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.\r\r\n- Septicaemia caused by Salmonella dublin and Streptococcus pyogenes.\r\r\n- Erysipelas caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\r\r\n- The product can also be used in the control of enzootic abortion in sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\n- Do not use in horses, cats and dogs.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals suffering from renal or hepatic damage.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage\r\r\n- The recommended dosage rate is 20 mg/kg bodyweight (i.e.1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight) by deep intramuscular injection. This product is recommended for a single administration only.\r\r\n- To ensure a correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.\r\r\n• Maximum dose at any one site: Cattle 20 ml, Pigs 10 ml, Sheep 5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for use\r\r\n- Do not dilute the product.\r\r\n- If concurrent treatment is administered, use a separate injection site.\r\r\n- Resistance against oxytetracycline may vary.\r\r\n- Use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing of bacteria isolated from the animal. If this is not possible, therapy should be based on local (regional, farm level) epidemiological information about susceptibility of the target bacteria. Inappropriate use of the product may increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to oxytetracycline and may decrease the effectiveness of treatment with tetracyclines due to the potential for cross resistance.\r\r\n\r\r\nOperator warnings\r\r\n- People with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product. In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n- In case of contact with eyes or skin, wash immediately with plenty of water as irritation may occur.\r\r\n- Take care to avoid accidental injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse Reactions\r\r\n- Hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic type reactions may occur in very rare cases based on post-marketing safety experience. In case of a serious anaphylactic reaction, the administration of appropriate treatment is recommended. Injection site reactions in cattle were observed very rarely based on post-marketing safety experience.\r\r\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals treated displaying adverse reaction(s))\r\r\n- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals treated)\r\r\n- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- rare (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nUse during pregnancy or lactation\r\r\nThe use of oxytetracycline during the period of tooth and bone development, including late pregnancy, may lead to tooth discolouration. The product can be safely administered to lactating animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions\r\r\n- Oxytetracycline may interfere with the action of bactericidal antimicrobials such as penicillins and cephalosporins and should therefore not be used simultaneously.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nThere is no known specific antidote, if signs of possible overdose occur, treat the animal symptomatically.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal periods\r\r\n- Cattle: Meat and offal – 41 days, Milk – 8 days\r\r\n- Sheep: Meat and offal – 24 days, Milk – 7 days\r\r\n- Pigs: Meat and offal – 20 days",

Caution is advised in their use in any other very small herbivores.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteraction\r\r\nIt is not advisable to use bacterial and bacteriostatic antibiotics in combination.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage\r\r\n- Reconstitution: Add 15 ml water.\r\r\n- Shake the bottle before use.\r\r\n- Administration: by the oral route.\r\r\n- Dosage rate: 12.5 mg / kg (i.e. 0.25 ml / kg).\r\r\n\r\r\n- For the accurate dosing of particularly small patients it is valuable to note that one drop from the pipette provided contains 2.3 mg clavulanate-potentiated amoxicillin. Therefore 5-6 drops / kg twice daily are recommended as a guide.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Dosage frequency: Dogs and cats should be dosed at the rate of 0.25 ml of reconstituted product per kg bodyweight twice daily.\r\r\n\r\r\n- For the majority of infections, including those of the skin, urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract, the above dosage regime is effective. Refractory cases however, particularly those of the respiratory tract, have shown improved cure rates by doubling the dose to 25 mg/kg bodyweight, twice daily (i.e. 0.5 ml of reconstituted product twice daily).\r\r\n\r\r\n- Duration of therapy: Routine cases involving all indications: the majority of these cases respond to between 5 and 7 days therapy.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Chronic or refractory cases: In these cases, where there is considerable tissue damage, a longer course of therapy may be required in that it allows sufficient time for damaged tissue to repair. Based on clinical trials, the following durations are suggested as guidelines:\r\r\n-- Chronic skin disease 10 - 20 days\r\r\n-- Chronic cystitis 10 - 28 days\r\r\n-- Respiratory disease 8 - 10 days\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy, lactation or lay\r\r\nThe product can be safely used in pregnant and lactating animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years.\r\r\n- After reconstitution: 7 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Store the reconstituted product in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).

        "description": "Composition\r\r\nEach 1 gm contains:\r\r\n- Colistin (as Colistin sulphate) 500 MIU=16.67 GM\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties\r\r\n- Colistin is a polypeptide antibiotic belongs to the class of polymyxins.\r\r\n- Colistin has a bactericidal action on sensitive bacterial strains, by disorganization of their cytoplasmic membrane, leading to an alteration of cell permeability and thus to a loss of intracellular material.\r\r\n- Colistin has a bactericidal power against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteria and in particular Escherichia coli. Colistin has very little activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungal organisms.\r\r\n- Gram-positive bacteria, as well as some species of Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus and Serratia, are naturally resistant to colistin.\r\r\n- However, the acquisition of resistance of Gram-negative enteric bacteria to colistin is rare and can be explained by simple mutation.\r\r\n- Colistin exhibits concentration-dependent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Following oral administration, high concentrations are observed in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., the target site, due to the low absorption of the substance.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- Treatment and metaphylaxis of gastrointestinal infections due to non-invasive colistin-sensitive E. coli.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species\r\r\nCalves, lambs, pigs and chickens\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration\r\r\n• For calves, lambs and pigs: 2 gm of product (Colistimed 5MIU/gm) / 100 kg body weight daily for 3-7 consecutive days.\r\r\n• For chickens:\r\r\n- 1.5 gm of product (Colistimed 5MIU/gm) /10 liter for 3-7consecutive days.\r\r\n- Duration of treatment should be limited to the minimum time necessary for the treatment of the disease.\r\r\n- Treatment duration should not exceed 7 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions\r\r\n- Colistin exerts concentration-dependent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Following oral administration high concentrations are achieved in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. the target site, due to the poor absorption of the substance’ These factors indicate that a longer duration of treatment than the one indicated in dosage section leading to unnecessary exposure is not recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings\r\r\n- Do not use colistin as a substitute for good management practices.\r\r\n- Colistin is a last resort drug in human medicine for treatment of infections caused by certain multi-drug resistant bacteria. ln order to minimize any potential risk associated with widespread use of colistin, its use should be limited to treatment or treatment and metaphylaxis of diseases, and should not be used for prophylaxis.\r\r\n- Whenever possible, colistin should only be used based on susceptibility testing.\r\r\n- Use of the product deviating from the instructions given in the insert may lead to treatment failures and increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to colistin.\r\r\n- The presence of the disease in the flock must be established before proceeding to metaphylatic treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-Indications\r\r\n- Do not use in horses, particularly in foals, since colistin, due to a shift in the gastrointestinal microflora balance could lead to the development of antimicrobial associated colitis (Colitis X)m typically associated with clostridium difficile, which may be fatal.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time\r\r\n• Calves  Meat: 14 days\r\r\n• Pigs  Meat: 7 days\r\r\n• Poultry & Lamb\r\r\n- Meat: 1 day\r\r\n- Eggs: Zero days\r\r\n- Not permitted for use in animals producing milk for human consumption\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place and used after opening for 60 days when stored at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place and used immediately after reconstitution.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\nLDPE plastic bags inside easy open metal cans containing 25 gm, 50 gm, 100 gm, 150 gm, 200 gm, 250 gm, 500 gm &1 kg powder with all data printed on the metal cans.",

This is the active group of two coenzymes which, in conjunction with apoenzymes, intervene at different stages of the degradation or synthesis of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids. This molecule also plays a determining role during the terminal oxidative degradation of substrates in the citric acid cycle, by fixing hydrogen during the terminal phase and transporting it to the flavin enzymes of the respiratory chain.\r\r\n- Cobalt is a trace element necessary for the activity of the rumen microflora. In ruminants, cobalt is then converted into vitamin B12 which, after absorption, participates in the metabolism of propionic acid, the main source of energy in these animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES\r\r\n- The iron provided by ammoniacal iron citrate is absorbed in the duodenum and stored in the intestinal mucosa in the form of ferritin. The liver, spleen, bone marrow and muscles also store part of it.\r\r\n- Cyanocobalamin (or vitamin B12) is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. When administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, peak plasma levels are achieved in less than one hour. Cyanocobalamin is excreted through the bile.\r\r\n- The absorption of nicotinamide (or vitamin PP) takes place throughout the intestinal wall. It is fast and complete. Distribution occurs rapidly in all tissues. Nicotinamide is transformed into an N-methylated derivative. Urinary elimination occurs in very small quantities in free form and especially in the form of metabolites.\r\r\n- Cobalt digluconate is poorly absorbed from the digestive tract. The highest concentrations are observed in the liver, adrenal and thyroid. When administered parenterally, 90% of cobalt is eliminated in the urine within 48 hours. After ingestion, elimination is via the feces.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store at a temperature not exceeding 25°C.\r\r\n- Shelf life as packaged: 18 months.\r\r\n- Shelf life at first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nEmpty packaging and any remaining product must be disposed of according to current practices governed by waste regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\nBox contains a colored type II glass bottle of 100 ml, chlorobutyl cap aluminum capsule.",

Only free ionized calcium in the blood is biologically active. In case of increased requirement of calcium, e.g. post-partum, hypocalcaemia may develop.\r\r\n- Magnesium is a cofactor in a number of enzyme systems. It also plays a role in muscular excitement and neurochemical transmission. In the heart magnesium leads to delayed conduction. Magnesium stimulates the secretion of parathyroid hormone and therefore regulates serum calcium levels. In ruminants, especially after intake of protein-rich grass, hypomagnesaemia may develop.\r\r\n- The product contains calcium is an organic compound and magnesium in form of magnesium gluconate as active substances. By the addition of boric acid, calcium borogluconate is formed, which increases its solubility and tissue tolerability. The addition of magnesium antagonises possible cardiac effects of calcium, especially following overdose or rapid infusion, and helps correct hypomagnesaemia, which frequently occurs in combination with hypocalcaemia.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- For subcutaneous use in milk fever, and in calcium, magnesium and glucose deficiency in animals\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species\r\r\nHorse, cattle, sheep, goat, pig\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage instructions\r\r\n- By S/C injection 1 ml of product / kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- Cattle & Horse: 250 – 500 ml / head (250 – 500 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- Sheep & Goats: 50 – 100 ml / head (50 – 100 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- Pigs: 50 – 100 ml / head (50 – 100 kg bodyweight)..\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions\r\r\nIt should not be used in case of hypersensitivity to any component of the combination.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra Indications\r\r\n- Hypercalcaemia and hypermagnesaemia,\r\r\n- Idiopathic hypocalcaemia in foals,\r\r\n- Calcinosis in cattle and small ruminants,\r\r\n- Septicaemic processes in the course of acute mastitis in cattle,\r\r\n- Application after high doses of vitamin D3 preparations,\r\r\n- Chronic renal insufficiency,\r\r\n- Concomitant or immediately following application of inorganic phosphorous solutions.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects\r\r\nTransient hypercalcaemia with the following symptoms may occur:\r\r\n- Initial bradycardia,\r\r\n- Restlessness, muscle tremor, salivation,\r\r\n- Increase in respiratory rate\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\nGlass vials: 10, 30 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 250 & 500 ml.",

Additionally, tocopherol appears to have a significant role in the oxidation process, thus suggesting an interrelationship between selenium and tocopherol in overcoming sulfur-induced depletion and restoring normal metabolism. Although oral ingestion of adequate amounts of selenium and tocopherol would seemingly restore normal metabolism, it is apparent that the presence of sulfur and, perhaps, other factors interfere with the proper utilization of selenium and tocopherol during the digestive process. When selenium and tocopherol are injected, they bypass the digestive process and exert their full metabolic effects promptly on cell metabolism.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- For the prevention and treatment of white muscle disease (nutritional myopathy) in calves and lambs.\r\r\n- Selenium-Tocopherol Deficiency (STD) Syndrome in weanling calves and breeding beef cows, Clinical signs are stiffness and lameness; chronic, persistent diarrhea; unthriftiness; abortions and/or weak premature calves.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCalves & lambs.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & administration:\r\r\n- Administer the following single doses subcutaneously or intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Administer by intramuscular injection only to calves.\r\r\n- Administer by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to lambs and by subcutaneous injection only to ewes.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Calves: 1.5 - 3 mg selenium salt + 150 - 300 mg Vitamin E acetate / 45 kg B.wt.

        "description": "COMPOSITION\r\n- Menbutone  100 mg / ml\r\n- Benzyl alcohol  2 mcL / ml (as preservative excipient)\r\n\r\nPharmacodynamic\r\n- Menbutone, the active ingredient in Bykahepar M, due to its action on the liver, pancreas and stomach, is a stimulant and normalizer of the functions of the digestive system.\r\n- In the liver has a real choleretic effect, with increased bile secretion, both in volume and in contained substances (pigments, dry matter and salts).\r\n- In the pancreas, it increases the secretion of pancreatic juice and, specifically, increasing the percentage of trypsin in the same.\r\n- In the stomach, the amount of gastric juice, and especially pepsin, slightly increased after administration of menbutone.\r\n- Secondarily, it is observed a slight increase in the content of mucin in the saliva. However, total salivation practically does not increase.\r\n- As a consequence of this set of actions, the administration of Bykahepar M in animals with gastrointestinal hypofunctionality, accompanied by secretory insufficiency, determines the regression of symptoms in 24-48 hours.\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic\r\r\n- Following parenteral administration, menbutone is rapidly distributed to the target organs (liver, pancreas and stomach).\r\r\n- One hour after injection intravenous 10 mg/kg p.v. blood concentrations of the order of 20 μg/ml are found, that decrease rapidly over time.\r\r\n- After 5 hours, only 10% is found of the initial amount administered.\r\r\n- The highest concentration of menbutone is found in the digestive system and, specifically, in the bile there is 11.6% of the dose at 2-4 hours post-administration, due to enterohepatic circulation of menbutone.\r\r\n- Excretion is largely through the urine. In the first 24 hours 27% of the dose is excreted and at 48 hours 30% has already been excreted. A small amount is excreted through faeces (4.4% of the dose) and milk.\r\r\n\r\nIndications\r\nNormalizer of gastric, duodenal and biliary functionality, indicated in those situations in which stimulation of digestive secretions is required, such as:\r\n- Bovine: Indigestions. Toxemia. Ketosis. Anorexy. Hepatic and pancreatic insufficiencies.\r\n- Porcine: Indigestions. Anorexy. intoxications. Hepatic and pancreatic insufficiencies.\r\n\r\nRoutes of administration:\r\n- Slow intravenous in cattle and pigs.\r\n- Deep intramuscular in cattle and pigs.\r\nPosology:\r\nCattle and pigs: 10 mg of menbutone / kg b.w. (equivalent to 1 ml of Bykahepar M per every 10 kg of live weight and day). If necessary, the dose can be repeated at 24 and 48 hours.\r\n\r\nOverdose\r\nSince the safety margin of menbutone is unknown, doses should be strictly respected. In the event of heart block, administer a cardiotonic\r\n\r\nSpecial precautions\r\n- IV administration should be done slowly (over no less than 1 minute) to avoid the occurrence of the adverse reactions.\r\n- It is recommended not to inject more than 20 ml IM at a single application point.\r\n- Do not administer to females in the last third of pregnancy.\r\n- Do not administer to lactating females.\r\n- Do not administer together with solutions containing: Calcium, Penicillin-procaine & Vitamin B complex.\r\n- Do not administer to animals with cardiac disorders, hyperthermia or obstruction in biliary ducts.\r\n- Do not administer to cats in any case.\r\n\r\nAdverse reactions\r\n- Following excessively rapid IV administration, tremors, rapid breathing, spontaneous defecation, cough, watery eyes, sneezing and fall of the animal.\r\n- After intramuscular administration, a painful reaction may occur in the animal.\r\n\r\nWaiting times\r\n- Cattle: meat: 2 days, milk: 2 days.\r\n- Pig: meat: 2 days.\r\n\r\nShelf life\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years\r\n- After first opening: 28 days\r\n\r\nStorage\r\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.",

Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross-reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.\r\r\n1) Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised, or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.\r\r\n2) Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions.\r\r\n3) If you develop symptoms following exposure such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning. Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n4) Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n• Very rarely hypersensitivity reactions (allergic skin reactions, anaphylaxis) may occasionally occur. If allergic reactions occur, the product should be discontinued immediately. Appropriate symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\r\r\n• In very rare cases the use of the product may result in instances of gastro-intestinal disorders (vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia).\r\r\n• The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals treated displaying adverse reaction(s)) \r\r\n- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals treated)\r\r\n- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- rare (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nThe tablets can be safely used in pregnant and lactating animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTION\r\r\n- Should not be administered concomitantly with bacteriostatic antibiotics, which are incompatible.\r\r\n- Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides and tetracyclines may inhibit the antibacterial effect of penicillin because of the rapid onset of bacteriostatic action.\r\r\n- The potential for allergic cross-reactivity with other penicillins should be considered.\r\r\n- Penicillins may increase the effects of aminoglycoside.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Recommended dose rate is 12.5 mg/kg, twice daily.\r\r\n- For oral administration only. The tablets are often accepted from the hand, even by sick dogs. Alternatively, the tablets may be crushed and added to a small quantity of food.\r\r\n- The majority of routine cases will respond to between 5 and 7 days therapy. Because of the low toxicity profile, the dose can be doubled if desired in refractory cases.\r\r\n- In certain indications, for example canine pyoderma and chronic cystitis, bacterial infection may be secondary to other pathology. For such cases long courses of antibacterial therapy may be required, in addition to diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition. In such circumstances overall treatment length must be at the clinician’s discretion, but should be long enough to ensure complete resolution of the bacterial disease.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nAmoxicillin is of a low order of toxicity and is well tolerated by the oral route in the dogs. Limited overdose normally produces no adverse effect. If signs do occur, for example of gastro-intestinal disturbance, treatment should be symptomatic.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nNot applicable.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, many clinically important bacteria product B-lactamase enzymes, which destroy this antibiotic. Clavulanic acid inactivates these enzymes, making the organisms susceptible to the amoxicillin.\r\r\n- ATCvet Code: QJ01CR02.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Store in a dry place.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\nLaminated, aluminium foil packs with 2 tablets in each blister card, packed in an outer carton box.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nMARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER\r\r\nZoetis UK Limited\r\r\n1st Floor, Birchwood Building\r\r\nSpringfield Drive\r\r\nLeatherhead\r\r\nSurrey\r\r\nKT22 7LP-----COMPOSITION\r\r\nEach tablet contain:\r\r\n- Amoxicillin 200 mg (as Amoxicillin trihydrate 229.5 mg)\r\r\n- Clavulanic Acid 50 mg (as Potassium Clavulanate 59.5 mg)\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cats and dogs\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nThe product has been shown to be effective in treating a wide range of diseases of cats and dogs including: Skin disease (including deep and superficial pyodermas); soft tissue infections (abscesses and anal sacculitis); dental infections (e.g. gingivitis); urinary tract infections; respiratory disease (involving upper and lower respiratory tract); enteritis.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\nThe product should not be given to rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters or gerbils.

It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue. To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation. Meloxicam also has anti-endotoxic properties because it has bean shown to inhibit production of thromboxane B2 induced by E. coli endotoxin administration in calves, lactating cows.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n» Cattle\r\r\n- for use in acute respiratory infections with appropriate antibiotic therapy to reduce clinical signs;\r\r\n- for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of acute mastitis, in combination with antibiotic therapy;\r\r\n- for use in diarrhoea in combination with oral re-hydration therapy to reduce clinical signs;\r\r\n- for the relief of post-operative pain following dehorning.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Horses\r\r\n- for use in the alleviation of inflammation and relief of pain in both acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders and soft tissue lesions;\r\r\n- for the relief of pain associated with equine colic.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep, goats\r\r\n- for use in acute respiratory infections with appropriate antibiotic therapy to reduce clinical signs;\r\r\n- for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of a cute mastitis, in combination with antibiotic therapy.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Camels\r\r\n- for inhibition of endotoxin-induced fever and prostaglandin production.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle, horses sheep, goats and camels\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in animals suffering from impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and haemorrhagic disorders, or where there is evidence of ulcerogenic gastrointestinal lesions.\r\r\n- Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\r\r\n- For the treatment of diarrhoea in cattle, do not use in animals of less than one week of age.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\nIn cattle, subcutaneous as well as intramuscular administration is well tolerated; only a slight transient swelling at the injection site following subcutaneous administration was observed in less than 10% of the cattle treated in clinical studies. In very rare cases anaphylactoid reactions, which may be serious (including fatal), may occur and should be treated symptomatically.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n• Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing including the use of an appropriate dosing device and careful estimation of body weight.\r\r\n• Avoid introduction of contamination during use.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle, goats: single dose of 2.5 ml / 150 kg body weight IV or SC.\r\r\n» Horses: single dose of 3 ml / 150 kg body weight IV.\r\r\n» Sheep, camels: single dose of 2.5 ml /150 kg body weight IV.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL TIME\r\r\nMeat:\r\r\n- cattle, sheep, goats: 15 days\r\r\n- horses: 5 days\r\r\n\r\r\nMilk: 5 days\r\r\n\r\r\nREMARK: in camels meloxicam can be detected in body fluids during 14 days after administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n- Shelf life before opening: 30 months.\r\r\n- Shelf life after opening: 28 days.\r\r\n- Before opening: do not store above 30°C.\r\r\n- After opening: do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING AND PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Treatment of calves with Melovem 20 minutes before dehorning reduces post-operative pain. Melovem alone will not provide adequate pain relief during the dehorning procedure. To obtain adequate pain relief during surgery co-medication with an appropriate analgesic is needed.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Precautions for use in animals\r\r\n- If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought. Avoid use in very severely dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals which require parenteral rehydration, as there may be a potential risk of renal toxicity. In case of inadequate relief of pain when used in the treatment of equine colic, careful re-evaluation of the diagnosis should be made as this could indicate the need for surgical intervention.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Precautions for the person\r\r\n- The galenical form (solution for injection) prevents the product being in contact with its user. Accidental self-injection may give rise to pain. People with known hypersensitivity to Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product. In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show this package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pregnancy and lactation\r\r\n- Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Interactions\r\r\n- Do not administer concurrently with glucocorticosteroids, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with anti-coagulant agents.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Overdose\r\r\n- In the case of overdose, symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\r\r\n- Do not use in new-born domestic animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE\r\r\nCardboard box with 1 colourless, type I glass injection vial (50 ml & 100 ml) dosed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium cap with an outer label and insert.\r\r\n\r\r\nReg no.: 4689/2020\r\r\n\r\r\nFOR VETERINARY USE ONLY\r\r\n\r\r\nPRODUCT LICENSE HOLDER\r\r\nDopharma Research B.V.\r\r\nZalmweg 24 - 4941 VX Raamsdonksveer - the Netherlands\r\r\n\r\r\nMANUFACTURER\r\r\nDopharma B.V.\r\r\nZalmweg 24 - 4941 VX Raamsdonksveer - the Netherlands\r\r\n\r\r\nEgyEuro Animal Health\r\r\nDr: Essam Soliman",

Like other ß-lactam antimicrobial agents, the cephalosporins inhibit cell wall synthesis by interfering with the enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. This effect results in lysis of the bacterial cell and accounts for the bactericidal nature of these agents.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhat Is It For?\r\r\nUp to 50% of new udder infections caused by environmental streptococci occurred during the dry period in a seven-year study.1\r\r\n\r\r\nUse SPECTRAMAST® DC on your operation to achieve:\r\r\n- Zero milk discard* so you can get them back in the milking string faster\r\r\n- One of the shortest meat withdrawal periods, helping you to maximize your management options.\r\r\n- Overall flexibility in milk and cattle management decisions.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow Effective Is It?\r\r\nSPECTRAMAST® DC treats the mastitis-causing pathogens you face. A study showed that a comprehensive dry cow program including SPECTRAMAST DC, Orbeseal and Enviracor-J5 can help reduce new infections during the dry period by up to 30%.2\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration\r\r\n- Infuse one (1) syringe into each affected quarter at the time of dry off.\r\r\n- Treatment: Wash teats thoroughly with warm water containing a suitable dairy antiseptic. Dry teats thoroughly. Milk out udder completely. Using an alcohol pad provided, wipe off the end of the selected teat using a separate pad for each teat. Choose the desired insertion length (full or partial) and insert tip into teat canal, push plunger to dispense entire contents and massage the quarter to distribute the suspension into the milk cistern.\r\r\n\r\r\nPack size\r\r\n10-mL disposable syringes in packs of 12 or 144",

Avoid contamination of the nozzle after removing the cap. After infusion it is advisable to dip the teats in an antiseptic preparation specifically designed for this purpose.\r\r\n1. After milking is complete thoroughly clean and disinfect the end of the feat (e.g. with cotton wool soaked in methylated spirit).\r\r\n2(i). Option 1: For short nozzle intramammary administration hold the barrel of the syringe and the base of the cap in one hand and twist off the small upper part of the cap above the indent mark (the base portion of the cap remains on the syringe). Take care not to contaminate the short exposed part of the nozzle.\r\r\n2(ii). Option 2: For full nozzle intramammary administration remove the cap fully by holding the barrel of the syringe firmly in one hand and with the thumb push up and along the length of the cap until the cap clicks off. Take care not to contaminate the nozzle.\r\r\n3. Insert the nozzle into the feat canal and apply steady pressure on the syringe plunger until the full dose has been delivered. Holding the end of the teat with one hand, gently massage upwards with the other to aid dispersion of the antibiotic into the quarter.\r\r\n4. Finally immerse the teats in a teat dip.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\n- Meat and offal: Zero days.\r\r\n- Milk: 96 hours after calving, if cows calve at least 54 days after treatment, milk for human consumption may be taken after 54 days plus 96 hours after treatment. The absence of antibiotic should be confirmed by testing before its milk is used for human consumption. This is advisable because of variation in the milking cow's ability to excrete antibiotic from dry cow products. In cows suffering from hypocalcaemia, it may be necessary to discard milk for a longer period.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach and sight of children.\r\r\n- Store below 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n- For use in animals\r\r\n- Do not bend the nozzle.\r\r\n- Do not contaminate the nozzle.\r\r\n- If calving occurs before 54 days after treatment, the absence of antibiotic should be confirmed by testing before the milk is used for human consumption. Milk for human consumption may be taken 54 days plus 96 hours after treatment.\r\r\n- In cows suffering from hypocalcaemia it may be necessary to discard milk for a longer period.\r\r\n- If the product is used in heifers during their first pregnancy the same precautions should be observed as in cows, i.e. infusions should be given not less than 54 days before calving and milk discarded for the statutory four days after calving.\r\r\n\r\r\nSummer Mastitis - It is unlikely that antibiotic treatment alone will control Summer Mastitis and therefore other measures should be implemented as part of routine management. These measures include:\r\r\n• Practicing some form of fly control on the farm.\r\r\n• Avoiding pasturing cattle on wet or wooded fields which are known to be associated with Summer Mastitis.\r\r\n• Post-infusion teat dipping of cows and heifers receiving prophylactic intramammary infusions for the disease.\r\r\n• Prompt attention to teat injuries or sores as these rapidly attracts flies.\r\r\n• Farms with an intractable problem should consider changing the calving pattern to avoid having animals at risk during the summer months.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions for the person\r\r\n- Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n- Penicillin and cephalosporins may cause sensitization (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact. Sensitivity to penicillin may lead to cross-sensitivity to cephalosporin and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.\r\r\n- Do not handle this product, if you know you are sensitized, or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.\r\r\n- If you develop symptoms following exposure such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the Doctor this warning. Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty breathing is more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy and lactation\r\r\n- Intended for use during the last trimester of pregnancy once the lactating cow has been dried off.\r\r\n- There is no adverse treatment effect on the foetus.\r\r\n- Not to be used in cows those are lactating.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nDispose of any unused product and empty syringes in accordance with guidance from your local waste regulation authority.\r\r\n\r\r\nOTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- For animal treatment only.\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for intramammary use cephalosporins\r\r\n\r\r\nATC Vet Code: QJ51 DA90\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by\r\r\nSchering Plough Sante Animale\r\r\nZA.La Grindoliere\r\r\n49500 Segre\r\r\nFrance\r\r\n\r\r\nMSD Animal Health",

It is presented in syringes containing 50 mg clavulanic acid as potassium clavulanate Ph. Eur., 200 mg amoxycillin as Amoxicillin Trihydrate Ph. Eur. and 10 mg Prednisolone Ph. Eur. in 3 g of suspension.\r\r\n\r\r\nUSES\r\r\n» Synulox Lactating Cow is specially formulated for the treatment of bovine mastitis. It has a notably broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against the bacteria commonly isolated from the bovine udder.\r\r\n\r\r\n(i) In vitro Synulox is active against a wide range of clinically important bacteria, including the following organisms, which are commonly associated with bovine mastitis: Staphylococci (including ß-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococci lincluding S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis), Actinomyces (including A. pyogenes), Escherichia coli (including ß-lactamase-producing strains). In addition, it is active in vitro against many less common udder pathogens including: Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides (including ß-lactamase-producing strains), Campylobacter spp, Klebsiellae and Pasteurellae.\r\r\n\r\r\n(ii) Clinically, Synulox Lactating Cow has been shown to be an effective routine treatment for mastitis in lactating cows. Cases responding succesfully to treatment include infections with the following major pathogens: Staphylococci (including ß-lactamase producing strains Streptococci (including S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis), Escherichia coli (including ß-lactamase-producing strains).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Dosage: A course of 3 syringes per affected quarter-one syringe every 12 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration: After milking, clean and disinfect the teat(s) with surgical spirit, insert the nozzle into the teat orifice and apply gentle and continuous pressure until the suspension is expressed. The treated quarter(s) may be milked out at the next normal milking time, but the milk should be discarded.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS ETC.\r\r\nDuring a course of treatment the situation should be frequently reviewed by close veterinary supervision.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING TIMES\r\r\n» Milk for human consumption must not be taken from a cow during treatment. With cows milked twice daily, milk for human consumption may only be taken from 60 hours (i.e. at the 5th milking) after the last treatment. With other milking routines, the basis of the veterinary surgeon's advice should be that milk may be taken for human consumption only after the same period from the last treatment (e.g. with three times a day milking and the product administered twice per day milk for human consumption may only be taken at the 8th milking).\r\r\n» Animals must not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment. Cattle may be slaughtered for human consumption only after 7 days from the last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nOPERATOR WARNINGS:\r\r\n- Penicillins and Cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact. Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross-reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious. Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised, or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations. Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions. If you develop symptoms following exposure such as sin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning.\r\r\n- Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing, are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store in a dry place below 25°C.\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach of children.\r\r\n- For animal treatment only.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE QUANTITIES\r\r\nSynulox Lactating Cow is supplied in cartons of 12 and 24 syringes.\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\nSynulox is effective against Klebsiella infections found in veterinary practice but it is not indicated for cases involving Pseudomenas species.\r\r\n\r\r\nMODE OF ACTION:\r\r\nResistance to many antibiotics is caused by ß-lactamase enzymes which destroy the antibiotic before it can act on the bacteria themselves. The clavulanate in Synulox counteracts this defence mechanism by inactivating the ß-lactamases, thus rendering the bacteria sensitive to amoxycillin's rapid bactericidal effect at concentrations readily attainable in the udder. The prednisolone in Synulox Lactating Cow has an anti-inflammatory action which helps to reduce the potentially destructive swelling and inflammation associated with mastitis without affecting the white cell response to infection.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured\r\r\nby Haupt Pharma for Zoetis Italy\r\r\n\r\r\nSynulox is a trademark of Pfizer Inc., NY, USA\r\r\n\r\r\nDate of preparation: November 1997",

Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds or this Class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n- Its convenience, broad-spectrum efficacy and wide safety margin make it an excellent antiparasitic product for cattle, sheep and swine.\r\r\n- One low-volume dose effectively controls internal and external parasites of cattle and swine and internal parasites of sheep that can impair health and productivity.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms: *Ostertagia ostertagi (adults and fourth, stage larvae including inhibited O. ostertagi); O. lyrata (adults); Haemonchus placei (adults and fourth Stage larvae); Trichöstoogylus axei (adults and fourth stage larvae); T. colubritormis (adults); Cooperia oncophora adults and fourth stage larvae); C. punctata(adults); Oesophagostomum radiatum (adults and fourth stage larvae); Strongyloides papillosus (adults).\r\r\n- Eye worms: Thelazia spp.\r\r\n- Lungworms: *Dictyocaulus viviparus (adults and fourth stage larvae).\r\r\n- Cattle grubs (internal parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis; H. lineatum.\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli; Haematopinus ervsternus; Solenopotes caplatus.\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis; Psoroptes ovis (syn.

Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a family of highly active, broad spectrum antiparasitic agents which are isolated from fermentation of the soil organism Streptomyces avermitilis.\r\r\n- Noromectin Injection is a 1% w/v sterile solution of ivermectin. At the rate of 1 ml per 50 kg bodyweight by subcutaneous injection, this formulation wil deliver the recommended dosage level of 200 mcg ivermectin per kg bodyweight.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRODUCT INDICATIONS\r\r\nNoromectin Iniection is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the following harmful species of gastro-intestinal roundworms, lungworms, eyeworms, warbles, mites and lice.\r\r\n\r\r\n» GIT roundworms (adult and fourth stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited larval stages), Ostertagia lyrata, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongyus colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia pectinata, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult), Nematodirus helvetianus (adult), Nematodirus spathiger (adult), and Trichuris spp (adult).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lungworms (adult and fourth stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus\r\r\n\r\r\n» Eyeworms (adult): Thelazia spp\r\r\n\r\r\n» Warbles: Hypoderma bovis and Hypoderma lineatum\r\r\n\r\r\n» Mites: Psoroptes bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, and Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Ticks: Orithodoros savignyi\r\r\n\r\r\n» Tropical Cattle Grub: Dermatobia Hominis\r\r\n\r\r\n» Screw worm Fly: Chrysomyia bezziana\r\r\n\r\r\n» Other Roundworms: Parafilaria bovicola\r\r\n\r\r\nNoromectin Injection may also be used as an aid in the control of the biting louse Damalinia bovis, tropical cattle ticks: Boophilus microplus, B. decoloratus and the mange mite Chorioptes bovis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPersistent Activity\r\r\nWhen cattle have to graze on pasture contaminated with infective larvae of cattle nematodes, treatment with Noromectin Injection at the recommended dose rate controls re-infection with Haemonchus placei, Cooperia spp and Trichostrongylus axei acquired up to 14 days after treatment, Ostertagia ostertagi and Oesophagostomum radiatum acquired up to 21 days after treatment and Dictyocaulus viviparus acquired up to 28 days after treatment. To obtain optimal benefit from the persistent activity of Noromectin Injection, it is recommended that calves which are set-stocked in their first grazing season should be treated 3, 8 and 13 weeks after the day of turnout. This can protect the animals from parasitic gasto-enteritis and lungworm disease throughout the grazing season, provided they are set-stocked, all the calves are included in the program, and that no untreated cattle are added to the pasture. Treated calves should always be monitored according to good husbandry practices.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE\r\r\nNoromectn Injection should be given only by subcutaneous injection at the recommended dosage level of 200 mcg ivermectin per kilogram bodyweight. Each ml contains 10 mg of ivermectin sufficient to treat 50 kg of bodyweight. Use the following dosage schedule.\r\r\n\r\r\nbodyweight (kg) >> volume (ml)\r\r\n• Up to 50 kg >> 1 ml\r\r\n• 51 - 100 kg >> 2 ml\r\r\n• 101 - 150 kg >> 3 ml\r\r\n• 151 - 200 kg >> 4 ml\r\r\n• 201 - 250 kg >> 5 ml\r\r\n• 251 - 300 kg >> 6 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nADMINISTRATION\r\r\nNoromectin Injection is to be given subcutaneously only. Inject under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder. The injection may be given with any standard automatic, multi-dose or single dose hypodermic syringe. Use of a 17 gauge, half-inch (15 - 20 mm) needle is suggested. Replace with a fresh sterile needle after every 10 - 12 animals. Injection of animals with wet or dirty hides is not recommended. If using a hypodermic syringe, use a separate sterile needle to withdraw Noromectin Injection from the pack.\r\r\n\r\r\nMODE OF ACTION\r\r\nIvermectin paralyses and ultimately kills parasitic nematodes, arachnids and insects by its effect on the nervous system of these parasites. At therapeutic doses, Ivermectin has no adverse effect on cattle since it does not readily penetrate their central nervous systems. Ivermectin belongs to the avermectin class of anthelmintic endectocides.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRODUCT ADVANTAGES\r\r\n» LOW-VOLUME INJECTION: Noromectin Injection is highly effective against internal and external parasites at a dose volume of 1 ml per 50 kg bodyweight. It can be administered quickly and easily.\r\r\n» BROAD SPECTRUM: Noromectin Injection provides broad-spectrum efficacy against roundworms, lungworms, eyeworms, warbles, mites and lice.\r\r\n» SAFETY: Studies have demonstrated a wide safety margin and the recommended use level had no adverse effect on breeding performance.\r\r\n\r\r\nWHEN TO USE IVERMECTIN INJECTION FOR BEST RESULTS\r\r\nThe suggested dosing programme has been developed to make the best use of the properties of Noromectin Injection. Your veterinary surgeon will be able to provide further advice.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Stomach and Gut Roundworms\r\r\n- Roundworm larvae may survive on the pasture over the winter in great numbers. They infect grazing cattle immediately after turnout, maturing into egg laying worms and causing increased pasture contamination. Early season treatment with Noromectin keeps down the population of worms in your stock and reduces the number of worm eggs passed onto the pasture to cause later infection.\r\r\n- Where young cattle are set-stocked, treatments with Noromectin Injection 3, 8 and 13 weeks after an April/May turnout will give season long control of parasitic gastro-enteritis and parasitic bronchitis.\r\r\n- Where clean pasture will be available during the summer, give a summer treatment with Noromectin Injection and move stock to the clean pasture within two weeks of treatment. If stock are introduced to pasture contaminated by cattle grazing earlier in the year, it is advisable to continue treating with Noromectin Injection at regular 5-6 weekly intervals to prevent the build up of worm parasites.\r\r\n- Ostertagia larvae picked up from the pasture in late summer and early autumn can remain dormant in the stomach wall for many months. In late winter or spring they resume development, resulting in serious disease. Autumn treatment with Noromectin Injection kills these larvae, and prevents Type II ostertagiasis.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lungworm\r\r\n- Outbreaks of husk (hoose) are most common in summer and autumn. Routine treatment with Noromectin Injection for stomach and gut roundworm control, e.g., at 3 weeks, 8 weeks, and 13 weeks after turnout can be used to control lungworm infection.\r\r\n- Where outbreaks of husk occur, treat promptly with Noromectin Injection and move stock to clean pasture within 2 weeks of treatment. However, note that lungworm larvae can survive in soil for up to a year or more, and it may be difficult to ensure that the pasture is 'clean'. If clean pastures are unavailable, treatment at 6 weekly intervals should control lungworm until housing.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Eyeworms\r\r\n- The presence of these worms may produce irritation and excessive tear formation in the eye. These tears attract flies which are responsible for the\r\r\ntransmission of infection to other cattle. The eyeworms are present throughout the year but transmission from one animal to another, and the annoyance caused by the flies, occurs only during the summer months.\r\r\n- Treatment with Noromectin Injection is fully effective in controlling adult eyeworms in cattle at any time of year.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lice and Mites\r\r\nAutumn treatment with Noromectin Injection controls sucking lice, sarcoptic and psoroptic mange mites as infections start to build up. Noromectin Injection may also be used as an aid in the control of biting lice and chorioptic mange mites, but complete elimination may not occur. Treat all animals in contact with each other to prevent cross infection.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Warbles\r\r\n- The best time to treat is in autumn or early winter, when Noromectin Injection stops the small migrating larvae before they have time to cause serious damage. Treatment with Noromectin Injection kills all stages of warble larvae and may be given whenever convenient for the farmer.\r\r\n- In spring, warbles show as lumps on the backs of previously untreated cattle. Treatment with Noromectin Injection kills these larvae, thus further reducing the population of adult flies for the next season.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE INFORMATION\r\r\n» Noromectin Injection is available in four ready-to-use sizes 50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml and 500 ml volumes.\r\r\n- The 50ml pack is a multiple dose, rubber-capped bottle. Each bottle contains sufficient solution to treat 10 cattle of 250 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- The 100ml pack is a multiple dose, rubber-capped bottle. Each bottle contains sufficient solution to treat 20 cattle of 250 Kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- The 250ml pack is a multiple dose, rubber-capped bottle. Each bottle contains sufficient solution to treat 50 cattle of 250 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- The 500ml pack is a multiple dose, rubber-capped bottle. Each bottle contains sufficient solution to treat 100 cattle of 250 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\nCattle must not be treated within 35 days of slaughter for human consumption.

This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use. Do not smoke or eat while handling the product. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\n______________________________\r\r\n\r\r\n(((SHEEP)))\r\r\nUSES:\r\r\n- For the treatment and control of psoroptic mange (sheep scab), gastrointestinal nematodes, lungworms and nasal bots of sheep.\r\r\n- Noromectin Injection for Sheep at the recommended dosage level of 200 micrograms ivermectin per kg bodyweight effectively controls the following parasites of sheep:\r\r\n» GIT roundworms, (adult and fourth stage larvae): Ostertagia circumcincta, O. trifurcata, Haemonchus Contortus, Trichostrongylus axei (adults) T. colubriformis and T. vitrinus (adults), Cooperia curticei, Oesophagostomum venulosum, O. columbianum, Nematodirus filicollis. Chabertia ovina, Trichuris ovis (adults).\r\r\n\r\r\n* Inhibited larval stages and benzimidazole resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia circumcincta are also controlled.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lungworms: Dicytocaulus filaria (adults and fourth stage larvae), Protostrongylus rufescens (adults).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Mange Mites: Psoroptes ovis, Sarcopties scarbei.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Nasal bot: Oestrus ovis (all larval stages).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISSTRATION\r\r\n» Dosage: 0.5 ml per 25 kg bodyweight (based on a recommended dosage level of 200 mcg ivermectin per kilogram bodyweight).\r\r\n» Administration: for the treatment of gastro-intestinal roundworms, lungworms and nasal bots, inject once subcutaneously in the neck, using aseptic technique, A sterile 17 gauge x 1/2 inch needle is recommended. For the treatment and control of Psoroptes ovis (sheep scab), two injections with a seven day interval are required to treat clinical signs of scab and to eliminate living mites.\r\r\n- Noromectin Injection for sheep can be administered to sheep at any stage of pregnancy or lactation provided that the milk is not intended for human consumption.\r\r\n- Noromectin Injection for sheep will not affect the fertility of breeding ewes and can be given to all ages of animals including young lambs.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ETC:\r\r\n- Sheep must not be slaughtered for human consumption until 35 days after the last treatment.\r\r\n- Treatment of psoroptic mange (sheep scab) with one injection is not recommended, because although a clinical improvement may be seen elimination of all mites may not occur.\r\r\n- Sheep scab (Psoroptes ovis) is an extremely contagious external parasite of sheep. Following treatment of infected sheep, great care must be taken to avoid re-infestation, as mites may be viable for up to 15 days off the sheep. It is important to ensure all sheep which have been in contact with infected sheep are treated. Contact between treated infected and non-infected flocks must be avoided until at least 7 days after the last treatment. Since no milk withholding period has been established do not treat lactating ewes where milk is to be used for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTAINER DISPOSAL\r\r\nEXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO FISH AND AQUATIC LIFE. Do not contaminate surface water or ditches with product or used container. Drug containers and any residual contents should be disposed of safely, i.e., by burying in waste ground away from water courses.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Animal Treatment Only.\r\r\n\r\r\nKeep out of reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nNoromectin Injection is a low volume product for cattle and sheep: it should not be used in other species as adverse reactions, such as fatalities in dogs, may occur.

The avermectins are macrocyclic fermentation products of an actinomycete, Streptomyces avermitilis.\r\r\n- Ivermectin paralizes nematodes and arthropods by stimulating GABA-mediated chloride ion conductance and the result is the blocking of postsynaptic transmission of nerve impulses.\r\r\n- In mammals, GABA-ergic neurons are found only in the CNS. Since ivermectin do not readily cross the mammalian blood-brain barrier, it has a wide safety margin in mammals.\r\r\n- Ivermectin is well absorbed with greater bio-availability after subcutaneous than after oral administration. The liver and fat contain the highest residues, with little in the muscle and kidney. Fecal excretion is the main route of elimination, with the remainder appearing in the urine.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications for species:\r\r\n» Cattle: Treatment of the following internal and external parasites:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adults and fourth stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi (included inhibited forms), O. lyrata, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora, C. punctata, C. pectinata, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Bunostomum phlebotomum (adults only), Nematodirus helvetianus (adults only), N. spathiger (adults only).\r\r\n- Lungworms: Dictyocaulus viviparus (adults and L4)\r\r\n- Grubs (the three parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatum\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Lignonathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei, Psoroptes ovis (var. bovis)\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep: Treatment of the following internal and external parasites:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adults and immature): Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta, O. trifurcata, Trichostrongylus axei (adults only), T. vitrinus (adults only), T. colubriformis, Nematodirus fillicolis, Cooperia curticei, Oesophagostomum colombianum, O. venulosum, Chabertia ovina, Trichuris ovis (adults only).\r\r\n- Lungworms (adults and immature): Dictyocaulus filaria, Protostrongylus rujesceus.\r\r\n- Nasal botfly: Oestrus ovis (all the larval stages).\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes Scabiei, Psoroptes comunis (var. ovis).\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\nCattle and Sheep: 1 ml Promectine per 50 kg of body weight (eq 0.2 mg per kg body weight) by subcutaneous route, in a single dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-Indications:\r\r\n- Contraindicated for calves less than 12 weeks of age.\r\r\n- Don't use in newly born pet animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects:\r\r\nPain inflammation reaction may be seen in some animals. These site reactions disappear without treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for use:\r\r\n- It's not for intravenous or intramuscular use.\r\r\n- Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant to reduce risk of clostridial infection of the injection site. In case of infection the animals should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.\r\r\n- In cattle inject under the loose skin in front or behind the shoulder. In swine, inject in the neck under the skin, immediately behind the ear.\r\r\n- Divide doses greater than 10 ml between two injection sites to reduce occasional site reactions.\r\r\n- Promectine is effective in all stages of cattle grubs. However, for most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly season. Destruction of Hypoderma larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions. Killing Hypoderma lineatum when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus may cause salivation and bloat; killing Hypoderma bovis when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis.

The product is also ovicidal against fluke and roundworm eggs.\r\r\n- Benzimidazoles bind to nematode tubulin, a protein necessary for the formation and viability of microtubules. This occurs primarily in absorptive intestinal cells resulting in the absence of microtubules in the intestinal cells of the nematode, with the result that these cells cannot absorb nutrients, thus causing a consequent reduction in glycogen and effective starvation of the parasites. Structural differences have been shown to exist between tubulin from mammalian and helminth sources, resulting in the preferential toxicity of albendazole to the helminth and not to the host. Benzimidazoles have also been shown to inhibit the fumarate reductase system of helminthes and impair energy production.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nA broad spectrum multi-purpose anthelmintic for the control of mature and developing immature forms of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, tapeworms and adult liver fluke in cattle and sheep.

Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gatedchloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n- Clorsulon is rapidly absorbed into the circulating blood. Erythrocytes with bound drug as well as plasma are ingested by Fasciola hepatica. Adult Fasciola hepatica are killed by clorsulon because of inhibition of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, which is their primary source of energy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal Roundworms (adults and fourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited O. ostertagi), O. lyrate, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis, Cooperiaoncophora, C. punctata, C. pectinate, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Nematodirus helvetianus (adults only), N. spathiger (adults only) and Oesophagostomum radiatum.\r\r\n- Lungworms (adults and fourth-stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n- Liver Flukes: Fasciola hepatica (adults only).\r\r\n- Cattle Grubs (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis and H. lineatum.\r\r\n- Sucking Lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus and Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n- Mange Mites (cattle scab): Psoroptes ovis (syn.

This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve and muscle cells in nematodes and arthropods and causes paralysis and death of the parasites. In mammals, the neuronal receptors to which avermectins bind are localized within the central nervous system.\r\r\n- Since doramectin does not readily penetrate the mammalian CNS it has a wide margin of safety in animals when used as recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY:\r\r\nDECTOMAX injectable solution is safe for use in growing lambs or calves and reproductively mature males and females sheep and cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS (CLAIMS):\r\r\nDECTOMAX injectable solution is indicated for the treatment and control of cattle and sheep parasites sensitive to doramectin.\r\r\n\r\r\n» IN CATTLE\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (Adults and fourth stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited larvae), Ostertagia lyrata (adult), Haemonchus contortus  (adult), Haemonchus placei, Haemonchus similis (adult), Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus longispicularis (adult), Cooparia oncophora (including inhibited larvae), Cooparia pectinata (adult), Cooperia punctata, Cooperia spatulata  (adult), Cooperia surnabada (syn. mcmasteri), Nematodirus helvetianus, Nematodirus spathiger (adult), Bunostomum phlebotomum (adult), strongyloides papillosus (adult), Oesophagostomum radiatum, Trichuris discolor (adult), Trichuris ovis (adult).\r\r\n- Lungworms (Adults and fourth stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n- Eyeworms: Thelazia spp.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe sustained drug concentrations that result from its pharmacokinetics enable the product to protect animals against parasite infections and reinfections for extended periods following treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nDECTOMAX provides a protective period of up to:\r\r\n• 3 weeks against Ostertagia ostertagi.\r\r\n• 2 weeks against Cooperia oncophora.\r\r\n• 4 weeks against Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Grubs/Warbles (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Dermatobia hominis.\r\r\n- Screwworms (parasitic stages): Cochliomyia hominovorax.\r\r\n- Lice: Haematopinus eurysternus, Linognathus vituli, Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n- Mites: Psoroptes bovis (var. ovis), Sarcoptes scabiei.\r\r\n- Single host ticks: Boophilus microplus.\r\r\n- Biting Lice: Damalinia bovis (aid in control).\r\r\n\r\r\n» IN SHEEP\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms: Ostertagia (Teladorsagia), circumcincta (adults, L4), Haemonchus contortus (adults, L4), Trichostrongylus axei (adults, L4), T. colubriformis (adults, L4), T. vitrinus (adults, L4), Cooperia curticei (L4 only), C. oncophora (adults, L4), Oesophagostomum venulosum (adults only), Nematodirus spp. (adults, L4), Inhibited larval stages (L4) of Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta, including strains that are benzimidazole resistant, are also controlled.\r\r\n- Lungworms: Dictyocaulus filaria (adults only).\r\r\n- Mange mites (sheep scab): Psoroptes ovis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE:\r\r\nAdminister DECTOMAX injectable solution at a dosage rate of 200 µg doramectin / kg (i.e. 1 ml / 50 kg) body weight as a single injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nADMINISTRATION:\r\r\nDECTOMAX injectable solution can be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route.

Levamisole stimulates the parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia in susceptible worms. At higher levels, levamisole interferes with nematode carbohydrate metabolism by blocking fumarate reduction and succinate oxidation. The net effect is a paralyzing effect on the worm which is then expelled alive.\r\r\n- Levamisole's effects are considered to be nicotine-like in action.\r\r\n- Levamisole is believed it restores cell-mediated immune function in peripheral T-lymphocytes and stimulates phagocytosis by monocytes. Its immune stimulating effects appear to be more pronounced in animals that are immune compromised.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nA broad spectrum anthelmintic for use in the treatment and control of nematode infections. It should be used in cases of parasitic gastro-enteritis and lungworm disease caused by mature and developing immature forms of those organisms' sensitive to treatment with Levamisole Hydrochloride.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle & Sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Administer by subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n• Cattle: 1 ml / 10 kg bodyweight (7.5 mg Levamisole / kg bodyweight).\r\r\n• Sheep: 0.5 ml / 5 kg bodyweight (7.5 mg Levamisole / kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- Divide large doses between two or more injection sites.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose:\r\r\nIf recommended doses are exceeded animals may exhibit signs of impaired motor functions such as muscle tremors and increased salivation, which are of a temporary nature.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nAnimals must not be treated within a period of 14 days before or after treatment with organophosphorus compounds.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\na) In cases of lungworm infections, coughing may persist for a considerable time following successful treatment due to tissue damage caused by the parasites.\r\r\nb) Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class.\r\r\n- Under-dosing.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\n- Estimate accurately the live weight of animals to be treated.\r\r\n- After treatment animals should be moved to clean pasture to prevent re-infection.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions:\r\r\nAlthough normally non-irritant, the product may occasionally cause local reaction at the site of injection. This should resolve naturally in a short period of time.\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy, lactation or lay:\r\r\n- The product can be safely administered to pregnant or lactating animals.\r\r\n- Care should be taken when treating heavily pregnant animals and animals under stress from adverse weather conditions, poor nutrition, penning, handling, etc.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\n- Cattle (Meat): 28 days.\r\r\n- Sheep (Meat): 15 days.\r\r\n- This product must not be used in cattle and sheep producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Condition:\r\r\n- Store at temperature not exceeding 30°C away from light.\r\r\n- Used within 3 months after opening when stored at temperature 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nCarton box containing amber glass vials (Type II) of 30 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml or 500 ml Injectable solution with chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Type I) and aluminium cap+ label and insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nADWIA Co.

Flunixin meglumine acts as a reversible inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, an important enzyme in the arachidonic acid cascade pathway which is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides. Consequently, the synthesis of eicosanoids, important mediators of the inflammatory process involved in central pyresis, pain perception, and tissue inflammation is inhibited. Through its effects on the arachidonic acid cascade, flunixin also inhibits the production of thromboxane, a potent platelet pro-aggregator and vasoconstrictor which is released during blood clotting. Flunixin exerts its antipyretic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the hypothalamus. By inhibiting the arachidonic acid cascade pathway, flunixin also produces an anti-endotoxic effect by suppressing eicosanoid formation and therefore preventing their involvement in endotoxin-associated disease states. The product has been shown to have some benefits in the treatment of experimental acute pulmonary emphysema (fog fever).\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nIn horses, indicated for:\r\r\n• The alleviation of inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders.\r\r\n• The alleviation of visceral pain associated with colic.\r\r\n• Treatment of endotoxemia or septic shock associated with gastric torsion.\r\r\n• Other conditions in which the circulation of the blood to the gastrointestinal tract is compromised.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn cattle, indicated for:\r\r\n• The control of acute inflammation associated with respiratory disease.\r\r\n• Used also as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of acute mastitis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & administration:\r\r\n• For intravenous administration.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Horses:\r\r\n- For use in equine colic & musculo-skeletal disorders: 0.5 ml / 45 kg b.wt. once daily for 5 days.\r\r\n- For the treatment of endotoxemia or septic shock associated with gastric torsion and with other conditions in which the circulation of blood to the gastrointestinal tract: 11 ml / 45 kg b.wt. every 8-6 hrs. for up to 5 consecutive days.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle: 1 ml / 45 kg b.wt., repeat as necessary at 24-hour intervals for up to 5 consecutive days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautions:\r\r\n• Horses intended for racing and competition should be prevented from racing or competing when in need of treatment.\r\r\n• Horses that have been recently treated should be dealt with according to local requirements.\r\r\n• Cattle should be treated with flunixin in conjunction with disease-specific therapy and an improvement in housing conditions.\r\r\n• Avoid intra-arterial injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n• Do not exceed the recommended dose or the duration of treatment.\r\r\n• Do not administer to pregnant mares.\r\r\n• Do not use in animals suffering from cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease.\r\r\n• Do not use in dehydrated animals suffering from ileus-associated colic.\r\r\n• Do not use the product within 48 hours before the expected parturition in cows.\r\r\n• Do not use in mares producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects:\r\r\nFlunixin meglumine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Salicylanilides are hydrogen (proton) ionophores (Referred to as oxidative phosphorylase uncouplers.) The chemical structure of salicylanilides illustrates the possession of a detachable proton. This type of molecule is lipophilic and is known to shuttle protons across membranes, in particular the inner mitochondrial membrane. Closantel acts by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Closantel is a parasiticide with flukicide activity and efficacy against certain other helminths and arthropods. Ivermectin is effectively treatment & control internal and external parasites in Cattle and Sheep, \r\r\n\r\r\n- Ivermectin is derived from the family avermectins, which are isolated from fermentation of the soil organism Streptomyces avermitilis. Ivermectin paralyzes and ultimately kills parasitic nematodes, arachnoids, and insects by a unique effect on the nervous systems of these parasites. Ivermectin action is due to a neurotransmitter chemical that serves as a signal from one nerve cell to another or from a nerve cell to a muscle cell and is called gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), In round worms Ivermectin stimulates the release of GABA from nerve endings and enhances binding of GABA to a special receptors at nerve Junctions, thus interrupting nerve impulses and leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. The same effect occurs in mites & lice. Ivermectin has no effect on acetylcholine which is the principal peripheral neurotransmitter in mammals and does not readily penetrate the central nervous system of mammals were GABA functions as neurotransmitter.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nCattle & Sheep: For the treatment of mixed trematode (fluke) and nematode or arthropod infestations due to gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, eyeworms, warbles, mites and lice of cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration\r\r\n- Single dose by subcutaneously injection.\r\r\n- Cattle & Sheep: 1 ml per 25 kg b. wt.

Rafoxanide acts by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation.\r\r\n- Liver flukes treated in vivo or in vitro with rafoxanide show indirect evidence of uncoupling, including reduced ATP levels, decreased glycogen content and accumulation of succinate.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide also binds strongly to plasma proteins and is inactive until ingested by the parasite and separated from the plasma albumin by digestion.\r\r\n- For this reason rafoxanide does not affect the host's mitochondria in vivo. Only blood-sucking nematodes and flukes residing in the bile, through which salicylanilides are excreted from the host's body, are susceptible to rafoxanide.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle and Sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Fasciolasis: Caused by mature and immature F hepatica and F gigantica.\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal nematodes caused by (Haemonchus, Bunostomum, Oesophagostomum , and Gaigeria species).\r\r\n- Nasal bot fly in sheep caused by (Oestrus ovis).\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration:\r\r\n- 5 ml / 50 kg b.wt (i.e. 7.5 mg Rafoxanide / kg) by a single S/C injection.\r\r\n- repeat treatment is advised at 3 weeks interval to eliminate maturing flukes that may have escaped earlier treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautions:\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n1. Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n2. Underdosing which may be due to underestimation of bodyweight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device.\r\r\n- Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the tests strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-Indications:\r\r\n- Do not administer to animals with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.\r\r\n- Cattle: Do not use during the last trimester of pregnancy in heifers which are intended to produce milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Sheep: Do not use within 1 year prior to the first lambing in ewes intended to produce milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Don't use this product in newly born pets.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects: None\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy precautions:\r\r\nRafoxanide for use during pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- Meat: Withdrawal time for cattle and sheep is 60 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not authorized for use in cattle or ewes producing milk for human consumption including during the dry period.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\nKeep in temperature not exceeding 30°C, away from moisture.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackage:\r\r\nGlass vial of 50, 100 & 500 ml inside carton box with insert.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nArabcomed for Primavet Pharmaceutical Production",

E) and Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12); four active substances which interact on various metabolic mechanisms involved in the processes of detoxification, transportation and utilization of fatty acids for energy purposes.\r\r\n- Once absorbed, acetylmethionine releases methionine as pure amino acid. Cyanocobalamin bounds itself to specific plasmatic protein and rapidly diffuses through all tissues, particularly the liver, where it is stored; excessive cyanocobalamin is eliminated via the urine.\r\r\n- The passage of l-carnitine from the blood to the tissues takes place via active transport across cell membranes; it concentrates in tissues with high capacity to oxidize fatty acids: cardiac and skeletal muscles and liver. Apart for a minute portion, which is esterified, L-carnitine is not metabolized and is eliminated by renal function in direct proportion with the blood concentration.\r\r\n- Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is transported into the blood circulation by beta-lipoprotein to be largely distributed into tissues and stored in the liver, where it is metabolized; the elimination is mostly via the bile and partially via the urine.\r\r\n- Sterivit Injection is, therefore, indicated to provide nutritional support and is to be administered in adjunct to standard therapy in animals suffering from a wide range of dysfunctions and defective metabolic states at the level of various organs, such as: the liver, heart, striated muscles, vasal endothelia and immune system.\r\r\n- The active substances are non-toxic and do not create residue problems.\r\r\n- Sterivit Injection normalises metabolic equilibrium and leads to a qualitative-quantitative improvement in production.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVANTAGE\r\r\nThe high concentration of the active ingredients and the I.M. administration route allow full utilisation of the ingredients introduced, unlike other common intravenous detoxifying solutions, where a large proportion of the active ingredients is rapidly lost with the urine.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nSterivit Injection is indicated in cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, for nutritional support and is to be administered as an adjunct to standard therapy in animals suffering from toxic and metabolic disorders, in conditions of reduced hepatic functionality, in animals facing heavy and protracted physical stimulus and for the transition cow or for pregnant ewes, sows and mares.\r\r\n• Alterations in milk quality or quantity\r\r\n• Anorexia, dysorexia\r\r\n• Convalescence, postoperative course\r\r\n• Dietary imbalance and deficiencies\r\r\n• Poor performance\r\r\n• Physical fatigue and debilitation\r\r\n• Stress management\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Administer by the intramuscular route.\r\r\n- Cattle/Horses: 5 ml/100 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- Calves/Sheep/Goats/Foals: 0.5-1 ml/10 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n• Please make 1 injection a day and repeat daily for 3-5 days as required.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC\r\r\n- Sterivit Injection is a combination for injection of dl-acetylmethionine (acetylated hydrosoluble methionine), l-carnitine, dl-a-tocopherol (vitamin E) and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), four active substances which intervene in the metabolic mechanisms involved in detoxification processes and in the transport and utilisation of fatty acids for energy purposes.\r\r\n- Sterivit Injection is therefore indicated in support therapy of dysfunctions and dysmetabolisms to various organs and systems, such as the liver, heart, striated muscle, vascular endothelia and the immunological system.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC\r\r\n- Once absorbed, acetylmethionine releases the amino acid as such. The sulphate produced is excreted via the urine in the form of sulfanic acid.\r\r\n- Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) binds to specific plasma proteins and rapidly distributes to all tissues, more specifically the liver, where it is stored. Any excess is excreted principally by the renal route.\r\r\n- The transit of l-carnitine from the blood to the tissues takes place through an active transport mechanism across cell membranes. It is particularly concentrated in tissues with a high fatty-acid oxidising capacity: myocardium, skeletal muscle and the liver. L-carnitine is not metabolised except for a small part which is esterified. Elimination takes place by the renal route and is directly proportional to its blood level.\r\r\n- α-tocopherol (vitamin E) is transported round the circulatory system by means of β-lipoproteins. It distributes plentifully to all tissues and is stored in the liver, where it is partly metabolised. Excretion takes place principally by the biliary route, while a very small part is excreted via the urine.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nNone reported.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nThere are no contraindications to use during pregnancy and lactation.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS \r\r\nNot reported.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING\r\r\nSterivit Injection may occasionally result in allergic reaction, including possible anaphylaxis.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL TIME\r\r\nNil.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store below 25°C in a cool and dry place.\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach of children.",

It has no antigenic effect and repeated injections do not induce formation of anti-GnRH antibodies. Follicular cysts arise from mature follicles which do not ovulate and are more or less luteinised. The presence of these follicles results in irregular and repeated oestrus leading to nymphomania. The follicular cysts are caused by an insufficient secretion of gonadotrophic luteinising hormone (LH) by the pituitary.\r\r\n- Cystorelin® stimulates the release of gonadotrophic hormones, and particularly LH, inducing the rupture of the follicular cysts.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Treatment of follicular cysts in the cow, with or without signs of nymphomania.\r\r\n- Regulation of oestrus.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Intramuscular or intravenous routes.\r\r\n- One single injection of 2 ml (i.e. 100 mcg of gonadorelin) is generally enough per cow.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD: None\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\nStore below 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRESENTATION\r\r\n- Box with 10 X 2 ml vials.\r\r\n- Box with 20 ml vial.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by: Ceva Santé Animale - 10, av. de la Ballastière - 33500 Libourne - France\r\r\n\r\r\nFOR ANIMAL TREATMENT ONLY",

Gonadorelin is a decapeptide composed of the sequence of amino acids 5-oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2 a molecular weight of 1182.32 and empirical formula C55-H75-N17-O13. The acetate salt has a molecular weight of 60.05 and an empirical formula C55-H75-N17-O13 plus C2-H4-O2.\r\r\n» Gonadorelin is the hypothalamic releasing factor responsible for the release of gonadotropins (e.g., LH, FSH) from the anterior pituitary. Synthetic gonadorelin is physiologically and chemically identical to the endogenous bovine hypothalamic releasing factor.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY:\r\r\n» Endogenous gonadorelin is synthesized and/or released from the hypothalamus during various stages of the bovine estrous cycle following appropriate neurogenic stimuli. It passes via the hypophyseal portal vessels, to the anterior pituitary to effect the release of gonadotrophins (e.g. LH, FSH). Synthetic gonadorelin administered intravenously or intramuscularly also causes the release of endogenous LH or FSH from the anterior pituitary.\r\r\n» Gonadorelin acetate has been shown to be safe. The LD50 for mice and rats is greater than 60 mg/kg, and for dogs, greater than 600 mcg/kg, respectively. No untoward effects were noted among rats or dogs administered 120 mcg/kg/day or 72 mcg/kg/day intravenously for 15 days. It has no adverse effects on heart rate, blood pressure, or EKG to unanesthetized dogs at 60 mcg/kg. In anesthetized dogs it did not produce depression of myocardial or system hemodynamics or adversely affect coronary oxygen supply or myocardial oxygen requirements.\r\r\n» The intravenous administration of 60 mcg/kg/day gonadorelin acetate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. The intramuscular administration of 1,000 mg to normally cycling dairy cattle had no effect on hematology or blood chemistry.\r\r\n» Further, gonadorelin acetate does not cause irritation at the site of intramuscular administration in dogs. The dosage administered was 72 mcg/kg/day for seven (7) days.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS AND DOSAGE:\r\r\n» Cystic Ovaries\r\r\n- GONAbreed is indicated for the treatment of ovarian follicular cysts in dairy cattle. Ovarian cysts are non-ovulated follicles with incomplete luteinization which result in nymphomania or irregular estrus.\r\r\n- Historically, cystic ovaries have responded to an exogenous source of luteinizing hormone (LH) such as human chorionic gonadotrophin. GONAbreed initiates release of endogenous LH to cause ovulation and luteinization.\r\r\n- The recommended intravenous or intramuscular dosage of GONAbreed is 100 mcg (1 mL) per cow.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Reproductive Synchrony\r\r\nGONAbreed is indicated for use with cloprostenol sodium to synchronize estrous cycles to allow for fixed time artificial insemination (FTAI) in lactating dairy cows and beef cows. The recommended intramuscular dosage of GONAbreed is 100 mcg (1 ml) per cow, used in reproductive synchrony programs similar to the following:\r\r\n- Administer the first GONAbreed injection (1 mL) at Time 0.\r\r\n- Administer 500 mcg cloprostenol (as cloprostenol sodium) by intramuscular injection 6 to 8 days after the first GONAbreed injection.\r\r\n- Administer the second GONAbreed injection (1 ml) 30 to 72 hours after the cloprostenol sodium injection. Perform FTAI 0 to 24 hours after the second GONAbreed injection, or inseminate cows on detected estrus using standard herd practices.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET ANIMAL SAFETY:\r\r\nIn addition to the target animal safety information presented in the section addressing pharmacology and toxicology, target animal safety of, and injection site reactions to, GONAbreed when used with cloprostenol sodium were evaluated during the conduct of the effectiveness field studies. The incidence of health abnormalities was not significantly greater in cows administrated GONAbreed than cows administrated placebo injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nEFFECTVENESS:\r\r\n» The effectiveness of GONAbreed gonadorelin acetate) for use with cloprostenol sodium to synchronize estrous cycles to allow for FTAI in lactating dairy cows was demonstrated in a field study at 10 different locations in the US. Four of the locations represented conditions that would typically cause heat stress in lactating cows. A total of 1607 healthy, non-pregnant primiparous or multiparous lactating dairy cows within 40-150 days postpartum were enrolled in the study. A total of 805 cows were administered GONAbreed (1 ml; 100 mcg gonadorelin as the acetate salt) and 802 cows were administered an equivalent volume of water for injection as an intramuscular injection twice in the following regimen:\r\r\n- Day 0: 1 mL GONAbreed or sterile water for injection.\r\r\n- Day 7: 500 mcg cloprostenol (as cloprostenol sodium).\r\r\n- Day 9: 1 mL GONAbreed or sterile water for injection.\r\r\n» Fixed time AI was performed on Day 10, approximately 11-31 hours after the Day 9 injection. Cows were evaluated for pregnancy on Day 45 ± 5 days by trans-rectal ultrasound or rectal palpation. Pregnancy rate to FTAI was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in cows treated with GONAbreed (33.4%) than the pregnancy rate to FTAI in cows treated with water (13.6%). The environmental condition (heat stress or not heat stress) did not affect the conclusion of effectiveness.\r\r\n» The effectiveness of GONAbreed (gonadorelin acetate) for use with cloprostenol sodium to synchronize estrous cycles to allow for FTAI in beef cows was demonstrated in a field study at 10 different locations in the U.S.\r\r\n» A total of 706 healthy, non-pregnant, primiparous or multiparous beef cows within 40-150 days postpartum were enrolled in the study. A total of 364 cows were administered GONAbreed (1 mL; 100 mcg gonadorelin as the acetate salt) and 342 cows were administered an equivalent volume of water for injection as an intramuscular injection twice in the following regimen:\r\r\n- Day 0: 1 mL GONAbreed or sterile water for injection.\r\r\n- Day 7: 500 mcg cloprostenol (as cloprostenol sodium).\r\r\n- Day 9: 1 mL GONAbreed or sterile water for injection.\r\r\n» Fixed time AI was performed immediately after the Day 9 injection. Cows were evaluated for pregnancy on Day 55 ± 5 days by trans-rectal ultrasound. Pregnancy rate to FTAI was significantly higher (P= 0.0006) in cows treated with GONAbreed (21.7%) than the pregnancy rate to FTAI in cows treated with water (7.4%).\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION: Federal (U.S.A.) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n- Not for use in humans.\r\r\n- Do not use in domestic neonates.\r\r\n- Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children.\r\r\n- The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information.

Administer 1 mL (one dose) per estrus cycle, 48 hours prior to desired ovulation. Verify that the mare is in estrus and has at least one ovarian follicle between 30 and 40 mm in diameter.\r\r\n- SucroMate™ Equine is a suspension of deslorelin and settling will occur over time. Warm the product for 2 minutes by rolling the vial between the palms (to reach room temperature), or allow the vial to sit for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to administration. Shake the vial vigorously for 1 minute before use. Administer a 1 mL intramuscular injection into the thick musculature of the neck.\r\r\n- Prior to administration, it should be determined by rectal palpation and/or ultrasonography that the cyclic estrous mare has an ovarian follicle between 30 and 40 mm in diameter.\r\r\n- Effectiveness is contingent upon accurate diagnosis of estrus and detection of a developing follicle between 30 and 40 mm in diameter. Only 1 mL should be administered per mare during a given estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS:\r\r\n- contraindicated in horses known to be hypersensitive to deslorelin acetate.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING:\r\r\nFor use in horses (estrous mares) only. Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. For intramuscular (IM) use only. Do not administer intravascularly. Not for use in humans. Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n- The use of GnRH analogs in cycling mares has been associated with pro-longed interovulatory intervals.\r\r\n- SucroMate™ Equine has not been evaluated in mares less than 3 years of age.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS:\r\r\nInjection site swelling was observed following the administration which resolved within 5 days, and 7 – 14 days, respectively.\r\r\n\r\r\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\r\r\n- Deslorelin induces ovulation by increasing the levels of endogenous luteinizing hormone.\r\r\n- SucroMate™ Equine has been shown to induce ovulation within 48 hours of treatment in 77% of mares with a developing follicle between 30 and 40 mm in diameter.\r\r\n- This product is intended to optimize breeding management through induction of ovulation within 48 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE:\r\r\nStore at or below 8°C.",

        "description": "Natural prostaglandin hormone\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\r\n- LUTALYSE® Injection (5 mg dinoprost/mL) is a sterile solution containing the naturally occurring prostaglandin F2 alpha (dinoprost) as the tromethamine salt. Each mL contains dinoprost tromethamine equivalent to 5 mg dinoprost: also, benzyl alcohol, 16.5 mg added as preservative and water for injection.\r\r\n- When necessary, pH was adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. Dinoprost tromethamine is a white or slightly off-white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water at room temperature in concentrations to at least 200 mg/mL.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS FOR USE\r\r\nCattle: LUTALYSE Injection is indicated as a luteolytic agent. LUTALYSE Injection is effective only in those cattle having a corpus luteum, i.e., those which ovulated at least five days prior to treatment. Future reproductive performance of animals that are not cycling will be unaffected by injection of LUTALYSE.\r\r\n• For estrus synchronization in beef cows, beef heifers and replacement dairy heifers\r\r\n• For unobserved (silent) estrus in lactating dairy cows with a corpus luteum\r\r\n• For treatment of pyometra (chronic endometritis) in cattle\r\r\n• For abortion in beef cows, beef heifers and replacement dairy heifers\r\r\n• For use with FACTREL (gonadorelin injection) Injection to synchronize estrous cycles to allow fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in lactating dairy cows\r\r\n• For use with EAZI-BREEDTM CIDR® (progesterone intravaginal insert) Cattle Insert for synchronization of estrus in lactating dairy cows\r\r\n• For use with EAZI-BREEDTM CIDR® (progesterone intravaginal insert) Cattle Insert for synchronization of estrus in suckled beef cows and replacement beef and dairy heifers, advancement of first postpartum estrus in suckled beef cows, and advancement of first pubertal estrus in beef heifers.\r\r\n\r\r\nMANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS\r\r\nMany factors contribute to success and failure of reproduction management, and these factors are important also when time of breeding is to be regulated with LUTALYSE Injection. Some of these factors are:\r\r\na. Cattle must be ready to breed—they must have a corpus luteum and be healthy; \r\r\nb. Nutritional status must be adequate as this has a direct effect on conception and the initiation of estrus in heifers or return of estrous cycles in cows following calving; \r\r\nc. Physical facilities must be adequate to allow cattle handling without being detrimental to the animal;\r\r\nd. Estrus must be detected accurately if timed Al is not employed;\r\r\ne. Semen of high fertility must be used;\r\r\nf. Semen must be inseminated properly.\r\r\n\r\r\nA successful breeding program can employ LUTALYSE Injection effectively, but a poorly managed breeding program will continue to be poor when LUTALYSE Injection is employed unless other management deficiencies are remedied first. Cattle expressing estrus following LUTALYSE Injection are receptive to breeding by a bull. Using bulls to breed large numbers of cattle in heat following LUTALYSE Injection will require proper management of bulls and cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- As with any multi-dose vial, practice aseptic techniques in withdrawing each dose to decrease the possibility of post-injection bacterial infections. Adequately clean and disinfect the vial stopper prior to entry with a sterile needle and syringe. Use only sterile needles, and use each needle only once.\r\r\n- No vial stopper should be entered more than 20 times. For this reason, the 100 mL bottle should only be used for cattle. The 30 mL bottle may be used for cattle, swine, or mares.\r\r\n\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n1. For Estrus Synchronization in Beef Cows, Beef Heifers and Replacement Dairy Heifers:\r\r\n- LUTALYSE Injection is used to control the timing of estrus and ovulation in estrous cycling cattle that have a corpus luteum. Inject a dose of 5 mL LUTALYSE Injection (25 mg dinoprost) intramuscularly either once or twice at a 10 to 12 day interval. With the single injection, cattle should be bred at the usual time relative to estrus. With the two injections cattle can be bred after the second injection either at the usual time relative to detected estrus or at about 80 hours after the second injection of LUTALYSE Injection. Estrus is expected to occur 1 to 5 days after injection if a corpus luteum was present. Cattle that do not become pregnant to breeding at estrus on days 1 to 5 after injection will be expected to return to estrus in about 18 to 24 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n2. For Unobserved (Silent) Estrus in Lactating Dairy Cows with a Corpus Luteum:\r\r\n- Inject a dose of 5 mL \r\r\n- LUTALYSE Injection (25 mg dinoprost) intramuscularly. Breed cows as they are detected in estrus. If estrus has not been observed by 80 hours after injection, breed at 80 hours. If the cow returns to estrus, breed at the usual time relative to estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\n3. For Treatment of Pyometra (chronic endometritis) in Cattle:\r\r\n- Inject a dose of 5 mL LUTALYSE Injection (25 mg dinoprost) intramuscularly.\r\r\n\r\r\n4. For Abortion in Beef Cows, Beef Heifers and Replacement Dairy Heifers:\r\r\n- LUTALYSE Injection is indicated for its abortifacient effect in beef cows, beef heifers and replacement dairy heifers during the first 100 days of gestation. Inject a dose of 25 mg dinoprost (5 mL) intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Cattle that abort will abort within 35 days of injection.\r\r\n\r\r\n5. For use with FACTREL® (gonadorelin injection) Injection to synchronize estrous cycles to allow fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in lactating dairy cows:\r\r\nAdminister 2 to 4 mL FACTREL Injection (100-200 mcg gonadorelin) per cow as an intramuscular injection in a treatment regimen with the following framework:\r\r\n• Administer the first dose of FACTREL Injection (2-4 mL) at Day 0\r\r\n• Administer LUTALYSE (25 mg dinoprost, as dinoprost tromethamine) Injection by intramuscular injection 6-8 days after the first dose of FACTREL Injection.\r\r\n• Administer a second dose of FACTREL Injection (2-4 mL) 30 to 72 hours after the LUTALYSE injection.\r\r\n• Perform FTAI 0 to 24 hours after the second dose of FACTREL Injection, or inseminate cows on detected estrus using standard herd practices.\r\r\n\r\r\nBelow are three examples of treatment regimens for FTAI that fit within the dosage regimen framework described immediately above:\r\r\n» Example 1\r\r\n• Day 0 (Monday): 1st FACTREL\r\r\n• Day 7 (the following Monday): LUTALYSE\r\r\n• Day 9 (Wednesday): 2nd FACTREL + FTAI at 48 hours after LUTALYSE\r\r\n\r\r\n» Example 2\r\r\n• Day 0 (Monday): 1st FACTREL\r\r\n• Day 7 (the following Monday): LUTALYSE\r\r\n• Day 9 (Wednesday): 2nd FACTREL + FTAI at 48 hours after LUTALYSE\r\r\n• Day 10 (Thursday): FTAI 24 hours after 2nd FACTREL \r\r\n\r\r\n» Example 3\r\r\n• Day 0 (Monday): 1st FACTREL\r\r\n• Day 7 (the following Monday): LUTALYSE\r\r\n• Day 9 (Wednesday): 2nd FACTREL + FTAI at 56 hours after LUTALYSE\r\r\n• Day 10 (Thursday): FTAI 18 hours after 2nd FACTREL \r\r\n\r\r\n6. For use with EAZI-BREED™ CIDR® (progesterone intravaginal insert) Cattle Insert for Synchronization of Estrus in Lactating Dairy Cows:\r\r\n• Administer one EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert per animal and remove 7 days later (for example if administered on a Monday remove the following Monday).\r\r\n• Administer 5 mL LUTALYSE Injection at the time of removal of the EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert.\r\r\n• Observe animals for signs of estrus on Days 2 to 5 after removal of the EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert and inseminate animals found in estrus following normal herd practices.\r\r\n\r\r\n7. For use with EAZI-BREED™ CIDR® (progesterone intravaginal insert) Cattle Insert for synchronization of estrus in suckled beef cows and replacement beef and dairy heifers, advancement of first postpartum estrus in suckled beef cows, and advancement of first pubertal estrus in beef heifers:\r\r\n• Administer one EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert per animal for 7 days (for example, if administered on a Monday remove on the following Monday).\r\r\n• Inject 5 mL LUTALYSE Injection (equivalent to 5 mg/mL dinoprost) 1 day prior to EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert removal, on Day 6 of the 7 day administration period.\r\r\n• Observe animals for signs of estrus on Days 1 to 3 after removal of the EAZI-BREED CIDR Cattle Insert and inseminate animals about 12 hours after onset of estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- User Safety: Not for human use. Keep out of the reach of children. Women of childbearing age, asthmatics, and persons with bronchial and other respiratory problems should exercise extreme caution when handling this product. In the early stages, women may be unaware of their pregnancies. Dinoprost tromethamine is readily absorbed through the skin and can cause abortion and/or bronchiospasms. Accidental spillage on the skin should be washed off immediately with soap and water.\r\r\n- Residue Warnings: No milk discard or preslaughter drug withdrawal period is required for labeled uses in cattle. Use of this product in excess of the approved dose may result in drug residues. \r\r\n- Animal Safety Warnings: Severe localized clostridial infections associated with injection of LUTALYSE Injection have been reported. In rare instances, such infections have resulted in death.\r\r\n- Aggressive antibiotic therapy should be employed at the first sign of infection at the injection site whether localized or diffuse. Do not administer intravenously (IV) as this route may potentiate adverse reactions. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit prostaglandin synthesis; therefore this class of drugs should not be administered concurrently. Do not administer to pregnant cattle, unless abortion is desired. Cattle administered a progestin would be expected to have a reduced response to LUTALYSE Injection. \r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nCattle: Limited salivation has been reported in some instances.\r\r\n\r\r\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\r\r\n• General Biologic Activity:\r\r\nProstaglandins occur in nearly all mammalian tissues. Prostaglandins, especially PGE’s and PGF’s, have been shown, in certain species, to 1) increase at time of parturition in amniotic fluid, maternal placenta, myometrium, and blood, 2) stimulate myometrial activity, and 3) to induce either abortion or parturition. Prostaglandins, especially PGF2α, have been shown to 1) increase in the uterus and blood to levels similar to levels achieved by exogenous administration which elicited luteolysis, 2) be capable of crossing from the uterine vein to the ovarian artery (sheep), 3) be related to IUD induced luteal regression (sheep), and 4) be capable of regressing the corpus luteum of most mammalian species studied to date. Prostaglandins have been reported to result in release of pituitary tropic hormones. Data suggest prostaglandins, especially PGE’s and PGF’s, may be involved in the process of ovulation and gamete transport. Also PGF2α has been reported to cause increase in blood pressure, bronchoconstriction, and smooth muscle stimulation in certain species.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Metabolism:\r\r\n- A number of metabolism studies have been done in laboratory animals. The metabolism of tritium labeled dinoprost (3H PGF2 alpha) in the rat and in the monkey was similar.\r\r\n- Although quantitative differences were observed, qualitatively similar metabolites were produced.\r\r\n- A study demonstrated that equimolar doses of 3H PGF2 alpha Tham and 3H PGF2 alpha free acid administered intravenously to rats demonstrated no significant differences in blood concentration of dinoprost. An interesting observation in the above study was that the radioactive dose of 3H PGF2 alpha rapidly distributed in tissues and dissipated in tissues with almost the same curve as it did in the serum. The half-life of dinoprost in bovine blood has been reported to be on the order of minutes. A complete study on the distribution of decline of 3H PGF2 alpha Tham in the tissue of rats was well correlated with the work done in the cow. Cattle serum collected during 24 hours after doses of 0 to 250 mg dinoprost have been assayed by RIA for dinoprost and the 15-keto metabolites. These data support previous reports that dinoprost has a half-life of minutes. Dinoprost is a natural prostaglandin. All systems associated with dinoprost metabolism exist in the body; therefore, no new metabolic, transport, excretory, binding or other systems need be established by the body to metabolize injected dinoprost.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET ANIMAL SAFETY\r\r\n- Laboratory Animals: Dinoprost was non-teratogenic in rats when administered orally at 1.25, 3.2, 10.0 and 20.0 mg dinoprost/kg/day from day 6th-15th of gestation or when administered subcutaneously at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6, 7 and 8 or 9, 10 and 11 or 12, 13 and 14. Dinoprost was non-teratogenic in the rabbit when administered either subcutaneously at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg dinoprost/kg/day on gestation days 6, 7 and 8 or 9, 10 and 11 or 12, 13 and 14 or 15, 16 and 17 or orally at doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg dinoprost/kg/day on days 6-18 or 5.0 mg/kg/day on days 8-18 of gestation. A slight and marked embryo lethal effect was observed in dams given 1.0 and 5.0 mg dinoprost/kg/day respectively. This was due to the expected luteolytic properties of the drug.\r\r\n- A 14-day continuous intravenous infusion study in rats at 20 mg PGF2α per kg body weight indicated prostaglandins of the F series could induce bone deposition. However, such bone changes were not observed in monkeys similarly administered LUTALYSE Injection at 15 mg dinoprost per kg body weight for 14 days.\r\r\n- Cattle: In cattle, evaluation was made of clinical observations, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, organ weights, and gross plus microscopic measurements following treatment with various doses up to 250 mg dinoprost administered twice intramuscularly at a 10 day interval or doses of 25 mg administered daily for 10 days. There was no unequivocal effect of dinoprost on the hematology or clinical chemistry parameters measured. Clinically, a slight transitory increase in heart rate was detected. Rectal temperature was elevated about 1.5˚ F through the 6th hour after injection with 250 mg dinoprost, but had returned to baseline at 24 hours after injection. No dinoprost associated gross lesions were detected. There was no evidence of toxicological effects. Thus, dinoprost had a safety factor of at least 10X on injection (25 mg luteolytic dose vs. 250 mg safe dose), based on studies conducted with cattle. At luteolytic doses, dinoprost had no effect on progeny. If given to a pregnant cow, it may cause abortion; the dose required for abortion varies considerably with the stage of gestation. Induction of abortion in feedlot cattle at stages of gestation up to 100 days of gestation did not result in dystocia, retained placenta or death of heifers in the field studies. The smallness of the fetus at this early stage of gestation should not lead to complications at abortion. However, induction of parturition or abortion with any exogenous compound may precipitate dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta and/or metritis, especially at latter stages of gestation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEFFECTIVENESS\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- For Treatment of Pyometra (chronic endometritis) in Cattle: In studies conducted with LUTALYSE Injection, pyometra was defined as presence of a corpus luteum in the ovary and uterine horns containing fluid but not a conceptus based on palpation per rectum. Return to normal was defined as evacuation of fluid and return of the uterine horn size to 40mm or less based on palpation per rectum at 14 and 28 days. Most cattle that recovered in response to LUTALYSE Injection recovered within 14 days after injection. After 14 days, recovery rate of treated cattle was no different than that of non-treated cattle.\r\r\n- For Abortion in Beef Cows, Beef Heifers and Replacement Dairy Heifers: Commercial cattle were palpated per rectum for pregnancy in six feedlots. The percent of pregnant cattle in each feedlot less than 100 days of gestation ranged between 26 and 84; 80% or more of the pregnant cattle were less than 150 days of gestation. The abortion rates following injection of LUTALYSE Injection increased with increasing doses up to about 25 mg. As examples, the abortion rates, over 7 feedlots on the dose titration study, were 22%, 50%, 71%, 90% and 78% for cattle up to 100 days of gestation when injected IM with LUTALYSE Injection doses of 0,1 (5 mg), 2 (10 mg), 4 (20 mg) and 8 (40 mg) mL, respectively. The statistical predicted relative abortion rate based on the dose titration data, was about 93% for the 5 mL (25 mg) LUTALYSE Injection dose for cattle injected up to 100 days of gestation.\r\r\n- For use with FACTREL® (gonadorelin injection) Injection to synchronize estrous cycles to allow fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in lactating dairy cows: For a full description of the studies conducted for the use of FACTREL Injection and LUTALYSE Injection, please refer to the labeling for FACTREL Injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nHOW SUPPLIED\r\r\nLUTALYSE Injection is available in 30 and 100 mL vials.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE, HANDLING, AND DISPOSAL\r\r\n- Store at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). \r\r\n- Use contents within 12 weeks of first vial puncture.

Oestrus synchronisation\r\r\n2. Treatment of sub-oestrus or silent heat in cows which have a functional Corpus luteum, but do not express behavioural oestrus.\r\r\n3. Induction of abortion until day 120 of pregnancy.\r\r\n4. Induction of parturition.\r\r\n5. For aid in the treatment of chronic metritis or pyometra where there is a functional or persistent corpus luteum.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs: 2 ml\r\r\n1. Induction of parturition from day 111 of pregnancy.\r\r\n2. Post partum use: reduction of the weaning to oestrus interval (WOI) and the weaning to fertile service interval (WFSI) in sows with puerperal problems such as metritis in herds with reproductive problems.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Administer via intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- Full aseptic precautions should be taken. Use a sterile syringe and needle and make the injection through an area of clean skin. Care should be taken to avoid injection through wet or dirty areas of skin.\r\r\n- Avoid the introduction of contamination during use.\r\r\n- Should any apparent growth or discolouration occur the product should be discarded.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n1. Oestrus synchronisation:\r\r\n- One administration of 25 mg of dinoprost (i.e. 5 ml per animal), to be repeated if  necessary after 11 (10 to 12) days.\r\r\n- Animals treated during dioesurus will normally return to oestrus and ovulate within two to four days after treatment.\r\r\n- Animals treated with ENZAPROST®T may be bred by natural service, artificial insemination on detected oestrus or at fixed time insemination (72 and 96 hours after tne secona injection is usually recommended).\r\r\n\r\r\n2. Treatment of sub-oestrus or silent heat in cows which have a functional corpus luteum, but do not express behavioural oestrus: One administration of 25 mg or dinoprost (i.e. 5 ml per animal, to be repeated, if necessary after 11 (10 to 12) days.\r\r\n\r\r\n3. Induction of abortion until day 120 of pregnancy: One administration of 25 mg of dinoprost (i.e. 5 ml per animal). ENZAPROST®T may be used to terminate pregnancy in cattle until day 120 of pregnancy through its luteolytic effect.\r\r\n\r\r\n4. Induction of parturition: One administration of 25 mg of dinoprost (i.e. 5 ml per animal) on or after day 270 of gestation.\r\r\nThe interval from administration to parturition is one to eight days (average three days).\r\r\n \r\r\n5. For aid in the treatment of chronic metritis or pyometra where there is a functional or persistent corpus luteum: One administration of 25 mg of dinoprost (i.e. 5 ml per animal) to be repeated, if necessary after 11 (10 to 12) days.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs:\r\r\nTo avoid excessive broaching of the stopper when treating large numbers of animals using the 50 ml pack size, the use of a multiple dose syringe with a draw-off needle is recommended.\r\r\n1. Induction of parturition from day 111 of pregnancy:\r\r\n- One administration of 10 mg of dinoprost (i.e. 2 ml of per animal) within 3 days of expected parturition.\r\r\n- Response to treatment by individual animals varies within a range of 24-36 hours from administration to parturition his can be used to control the time of farrowing in sows and gilts in late gestation, treatment earlier than 3 days prior to predicted farrowing date may induce weak piglets.\r\r\n\r\r\n2. Post-partum use: One administration of 10 mg or dinoprost (i.e. 2 ml per animal) 24 to 36 hours after parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSAGE\r\r\nIncreased rectal temperature and a slight transitory increase in heart rate can be observed at 5 or 10 times the recommended dosage in cows and heifers.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS & WARNINGS\r\r\n- Don't treat animals if they suffer from either acute or subacute disorders of the vascular system, gastro-intestinal tract or respiratory system.\r\r\n- Do not administer to pregnant animals, unless it is desirable to induce parturition or interruption of pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\nNo Special warnings\r\r\n\r\r\nUNDESIRABLE EFFECTS\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n- The most frequently observed side-effect is increased rectal temperature. However, the rectal temperature changes have been transient in all cases observed and have not been detrimental to animal.\r\r\n- Limited salvation has been seen in some instances, The side-effects disappear within one hour after the administration of PGF2a.\r\r\n- In cattle, if used for induction of parturition, retained foetal membranes may occur more frequently, depending on the time of use of the product.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs:\r\r\n- Transient side-effects consisting of increased body temperature, signs of pain at the site of injection, increased respiratory rate, increased salivation, stimulation of defecation and urination, flushing of skin and restlessness (arching of back, pawing, and rubbing and gnawing the crate), dyspnea, slight ataxia, abdominal muscle spasms, vomiting and pruritus occur occasionally following the administration of dinoprost in pregnant sows and gilts.\r\r\n- These effects tend to parallel the signs exhibited by sows prior to normal parturition, only they appear to be condensed in time.\r\r\n- These effects are usually seen within 10 minutes of injection and disappear within 3 hours.\r\r\n- Nest building is a common behaviour 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of prostaglandin in sows that are housed in pen or pasture.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR USE\r\r\n- ENZAPROST®T is ineffective when administered prior to 5 days after ovulation.\r\r\n- Localised post injection bacterial infections that may become generalised have been reported. Aggressive antibiotic therapy, particularly covering clostridial species, should be employed at the first sign of infection. Careful aseptic techniques should be employed to decrease the possibility of post injection bacterial infections.\r\r\n- Do not administer by intravenous route.\r\r\n- Induction of abortion or parturition by using exogenous substances may increase the risk for dystocia, foetal mortality, retention of the placenta and/or metritis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION\r\r\n- Pregnancy status should be determined prior to injection since Dinoprost has been demonstrated to result in abortion or parturition induction when administered at sufficiently high doses in many animal species.\r\r\n- If pregnant, the unlikely possibility of uterine rupture should be born in mind, especially if cervical dilation does not occur.\r\r\n- Induction of parturition in pigs earlier than 72 hours prior to predicted farrowing date may result in reduced piglet viability.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTION\r\r\n- As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit the endogenous prostaglandin synthesis, concomitant administration of these compounds with ENZAPROST®T may decrease the luteolytic effects of ENZAPROST®T.\r\r\n- As oxytocics stimulate the production of prostaglandins, concomitant administration of these compounds with ENZAPROST®T may exacerbate the luteolytic effects of ENZAPROST®T.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n  Meat and offal: 3 days.\r\r\n  Milk: Zero hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nPigs:\r\r\n  Meat and offal: 2 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Prostaglandins of the PGF2a type can be absorbed through the skin and may cause bronchospasm or miscarriage.\r\r\n- Care should be taken when handling the product to avoid self-Injection or skin contact.\r\r\n- Accidental spillage on the skin, or accidental eye contact should be washed off immediately with clean water.\r\r\n- Impervious gloves should be worn to avoid skin contact.\r\r\n- Accidental injection may be a particular hazard to women who are pregnant, intending to become pregnant, or whose pregnancy status is unknown and to asthmatics and persons with bronchial or other respiratory problems,\r\r\n- Asthmatics and persons with bronchial or other respiratory problems should handle the product with care to avoid accidental self-injection and skin contact.\r\r\n- Pregnant women, women of child-bearing age, asthmatics and persons with bronchial and other respiratory problems should not use the product or wear disposable plastic gloves.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nNo major incompatibilities known.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Shelf-life as packaged: 2 years\r\r\n- Shelf-life after opening: 14 days\r\r\n- After first opening: do not store above 30°C.\r\r\n- Dispose of any unused product and empty containers in accordance with guidance from your local waste regulation authority.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE QUANTITIES\r\r\n- Box of 10 vials of 5 ml\r\r\n- Box of 5 vials of 10 ml\r\r\n- Box of 1 vial of 30 ml\r\r\n- Box of 1 vial of 50 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nManufacturer: Ceva Santé Animale 10, av. de la Ballastière - 33500 Libourne - France\r\r\n\r\r\nMOH Reg.

Two injections 11 days apart\r\r\n- Breed any animals showing estrus before the second injection, either on signs of estrus or at fixed times (see Special Warnings). The second dose may be given only to those cattle not seen in estrus during that time and is followed by breeding either on signs of estrus or at fixed times (see Special Warnings).\r\r\n\r\r\n2. In combination with GnRH analogues\r\r\na) \"Ovsynch\" protocol:\r\r\n- GnRH is administered on day 0, a prostaglandin injection is given on day 7 and an additional GnRH injection on day 9.\r\r\n- A single fixed-time artificial insemination may be done between approximately 12-24 hours after the last GnRH injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nb) \"Co-Synch\" protocol:\r\r\n- Same as \"Ovsynch\" with insemination given together with the second GnRH injection on day 9.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Recommended protocol for beef herds with most females non-cycling:\r\r\n- In combination with progesterone/progestagen releasing devices: As treatment duration with these devices is usually shorter than normal luteal phase, a prostaglandin injection is necessary, usually 48 hours before removing the device.\r\r\n\r\r\n(B) Therapeutic indications\r\r\n• Treatment of non-detected estrus associated with a functioning or persistent corpus luteum (absence of heat in the first 90 days post-partum)\r\r\n- After diagnosing the presence of a corpus luteum (by rectal palpation) treat as in above described protocol \"Two injections 11 days apart\"\r\r\n\r\r\n• Treatment of chronic endometritis / pyometra associated with a functioning or persistent corpus luteum\r\r\n- Treat with a single dose. In long-standing cases, treatment may be repeated after 10-14 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Treatment of ovarian luteal cysts\r\r\n- Where luteal cysts are detected together with lack of estrus, Estrumate is effective in triggering cyst regression and return to cyclicity.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Induction of parturition around normal term\r\r\n- Induction should take place as close to the predicted calving date as possible and not more than 10 days before. Inducion should not be attempted before day 270 of gestation measured from the confirmed date of conception, except in pathological conditions. All treated animals must receive adequate supervision.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Termination of pregnancy\r\r\n- Normal pregnancy can be terminated in cattle from one week after conception until the day 150 of gestation. Best results are obtained during the first 100 days. Treated animals should be carefully monitored until expulsion of the fetus and placenta is complete. In case of a pathological pregnancy (mummified fetus, hydrops of the fetal membrane), abortion can be attempted at any stage of gestation. Manual removal of fetus and/or fetal membranes may be necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\n» HORSES\r\r\n(A) Controlled breeding (as an aid to stud management)\r\r\nEstrus may be synchronized in groups of mares, allowing breeding at pre-determined times and to facilitate more efficient use and management of stallions and/or semen during the breeding season. In case of embryonic transfer (ET), it is also necessary to synchronize recipients with donors. Estrus usually starts within 3 to 4 days after Estrumate administration.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Single Estrumate administration\r\r\n- When breeding at the second estrus after foaling is desired, a single dose of Estrumate may be administered 6 to 8 days after the ovulation of the \"foal heat\" in order to hasten the occurrence of the second estrus. Similarly, when the last ovulation date is known, a single dose of Estrumate can be used to synchronize and time estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Two Estrumate administrations 14-18 days apart\r\r\n- This administration scheme triggers synchronization of estrus in a group of mares.\r\r\n\r\r\n• In combination with progesterone/progestagens based programs\r\r\n- A single dose of Estrumate needs to be administered on the last day of progestagen treatment (8 days long) in order to ensure luteolysis in all mares. Once estrus is detected and large follicles are present, hCG may be injected to trigger ovulation.\r\r\n\r\r\n(B) Therapeutic indications\r\r\nEstrumate can be used effectively to treatment of conditions associated with a functioning or persistent corpus luteum, such as:\r\r\n• Induction of luteolysis in case of prolonged diestrus or \"pseudopregnancy\"\r\r\n- Estrumate induces the regression of the persistent corpus luteum and results in return to estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Induction of luteolysis following early fetal death and resorption (during the first 40 days of pregnancy)\r\r\n- As soon as pregnancy loss (loss of the conceptus) is diagnosed, prostaglandins such as cloprostenol may be injected to hasten re-breeding.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Establishing visible estrus cycles in case of \"silent heat\" in barren/maiden or in early post-partum mares\r\r\n- Some mares may not display estrus signs despite the observation of a corpus luteum. If Estrumate is used to induce the regression of the existing corpus luteum, a new opportunity to detect estrus will be given to the breeder/stud master.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in pregnant animals unless the objective is to terminate the pregnancy.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals with spastic diseases of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- When used for induction of parturition and dependent on the time of treatment relative to the date of conception, the incidence of retained placenta may be increased.\r\r\n- If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle and horses\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Administration by Intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- Dairy or beef cattle: Single or repeated doses 2 mL Estrumate (eq to 500 mcg cloprostenol) per animal.\r\r\n- Ponies and donkeys: Single or repeated doses of 0.5 to 1 mL Estrumate (eq to 125-250 mcg cloprostenol) per animal.\r\r\n- Thoroughbreds, hunters and heavy horses: Single or repeated doses of 1 to 2 mL Estrumate (eq to 250-500 mcg cloprostenol) per animal.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Due to the possibility of post-injection bacterial infections, careful aseptic techniques should be employed.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\nEdible tissues and milk: zero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach and sight of children.\r\r\n- Do not store above 30°C away from light.\r\r\n- In order to protect from light keep the vial in the outer carton.\r\r\n- Shelf-life after first broaching of the vial: 4 weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\n- Do not administer intravenously.\r\r\n- Cattle which respond to a single prostaglandin injection will normally do so within 6 days of treatment. The response time after two injections is less variable. Animals may be inseminated on detection of estrus or possibly given two fixed time insemination at 72 and 96 hours after the second injection. If animals are still in heat at 96 h, an additional artificial insemination can be given. If a single fixed time artificial insemination is intended, prostaglandins should preferably be combined with GnRH (Ov-Synch or Co-Synch protocol) or progesterone/progestagen releasing devices.\r\r\n- Attention should be directed to the diet and condition of the treated animals. Sudden changes in feeding levels, in feed constituents and in housing, etc should be avoided around the time of the breeding program, as should any other factor, such as regrouping, which could reasonably be expected to lead to stress.\r\r\n- For successful treatment, animals should be cycling normally. Injecting them when the existing corpora lutea are over 5 days of age is a prerequisite for treatment's efficacy. A proper check of the ovaries (by rectal examination or ultrasonography) before treatment should avoid the disappointment of treating non cycling (anestrus).\r\r\n- The use of Estrumate is not recommended during pregnancy, unless abortion is intended.\r\r\n- The product can be safely used during lactation.\r\r\n- Do not mix with other medicinal products. Incompatibilities with strong acid/alkaline products. Concurrent use of oxytocin and cloprostenol increases effects on the uterus.\r\r\n- Do not exceed the recommended dose; an overdose will not accelerate corpus luteum regression.\r\r\n- The user should avoid direct contact with skin or mucous membranes. Prostaglandins of the F2a type may be absorbed through the skin and may cause bronchospasm or miscarriage. Care should be taken when handling the product to avoid self-injection or skin contact. Pregnant women, women in childbearing age, asthmatics and persons with other respiratory tract diseases should exercise caution when handling Estrumate. Those persons should avoid contact or wear disposable gloves during administration of the product. Accidental spillage on the skin should be washed immediately with soap and water. Should shortness of breath result from accidental inhalation or injection, seek urgent medical advice and show the doctor this warning.\r\r\n- Not used in newly born pet animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal product should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor animal treatment only\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by Vet Pharma Friesoythe GmbH Germany",

        "description": "Synthetic prostaglandin hormone\r\r\n\r\r\n■ estroPLAN (cloprostenol sodium) is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue structurally related to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α).\r\r\n■ Each mL of the colorless aqueous solution contains:\r\r\n- cloprostenol sodium 263 mcg (eq to 250 mcg of cloprostenol)\r\r\n- chlorocresol 1.0 mg as a bactericide\r\r\n- citric acid anhydrous 0.66 mg\r\r\n- sodium citrate 5.03 mg\r\r\n- sodium chloride 6.76 mg\r\r\n■ The pH is adjusted, as necessary, with sodium hydroxide or citric acid.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic Properties\r\r\n- Cloprostenol is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue structurally related to Prostaglandin F2*  (PGF2*), for use in cattle and horses. As a potent luteolytic agent it causes functional and morphological regression of the corpus luteum (luteolysis) in cattle and horses followed by return to oestrus and normal ovulation.\r\r\n- In non-pregnant cycling cattle luteolysis is usually followed by ovarian follicular development and a return to oestrus with normal ovulation in 2 – 5 days following treatment. In horses oestrus commences 2 – 5 days following treatment with cloprostenol, with normal ovulation occurring 8 – 12 days after treatment.\r\r\n- Note: There is a refractory period of four to five days after ovulation when cattle and horses are insensitive to the luteolytic effect of prostaglandins. estroPLAN has a good safety margin and does not impair fertility. No deleterious effects have been reported on the progeny conceived at the oestrus following treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic Properties\r\r\n- After its administration by injection, cloprostenol is metabolised to 9, 11, dihydroxy-15-cetoprost-5-enoic acid and 9, 11, 15-trihydroxyprost-5-enoic acid which rapidly disappears from the blood, being excreted via the urine in 5 – 6 hours.\r\r\n- Radiolabelled studies show blood levels between 0.0014 and 0.002 mg per ml at 20 minutes – 2 hours after its administration. Subsequently, blood levels fall rapidly, having an apparent half life of 1 – 3 hours, falling below 0.00004 mg/ml at 8 hours. No significant concentrations are found at 24 hours in the liver, muscle, heart, kidneys, uterus, ovaries, skin, brain and fat, nor in milk after 4 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nACTION:\r\r\nestroPLAN causes functional and morphoIogical regression of the corpus luteum (luteolysis) in cattle. In normal, nonpregnant cycling animals, this effect on the life span of the corpus luteum usually results in estrus 2 to 5 days after treatment. In animals with prolonged luteal function (pyometra, mummified fetus, and luteal cysts), the induced luteolysis usually results in resolution of the condition and return to cyclicity. Pregnant animals may abort depending on the stage of gestation.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nFor intramuscular use to induce luteolysis in beef and dairy cattle. The luteolytic action of estroPLAN can be utilized to manipulate the estrous cycle to better fit certain management practices, to terminate pregnancies resulting from mismatings, and to treat certain conditions associated with prolonged luteal function.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECOMMENDED USES:\r\r\n■ Unobserved Or Nondetected Estrus: Cows which are not detected in estrus, although ovarian cyclicity continues, can be treated with estroPLAN if a mature corpus luteum is present. Estrus is expected to occur 2 to 5 days following injection, at which time animals may be inseminated. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated twice at about 72 and 96 hours postinjection.\r\r\n\r\r\n■ Pyometra Or Chronic Endometritis: Damage to the reproductive tract at calving or postpartum retention of the placenta often leads to infection and inflammation of the uterus (endometritis). Under certain circumstances, this may progress into chronic endometritis with the uterus becoming distended with purulent matter. This condition, commonly referred to as pyometra, is characterized by a lack of cyclical estrus behavior and the presence of a persistent corpus luteum. Induction of luteolysis with estroPLAN usually results in evacuation of the uterus and a return to normal cyclical activity within 14 days after treatment. After 14 days posttreatment, recovery rate of treated animals will not be different than that of untreated cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\n■ Mummified Fetus: Death of the conceptus during gestation may be followed by its degeneration and dehydration. Induction of luteolysis with estroPLAN usually results in expulsion of the mummified fetus from the uterus. (Manual assistance may be necessary to remove the fetus from the vagina). Normal cyclical activity usually follows.\r\r\n\r\r\n■ Luteal Cysts: A cow may be noncyclic due to the presence of a luteal cyst (a single, anovulatory follicle with a thickened wall which is accompanied by no external signs and by no changes in palpable consistency of the uterus). Treatment with estroPLAN can restore normal ovarian activity by causing regression of the luteal cyst.\r\r\n\r\r\n■ Pregnancies From Mismating: Unwanted pregnancies can be safely and efficiently terminated from 1 week after mating until about 5 months of gestation. The induced abortion is normally uncomplicated and the fetus and placenta are usually expelled about 4 to 5 days after the injection with the reproductive tract returning to normal soon after the abortion. The ability of estroPLAN to induce abortion decreases beyond the fifth month of gestation while the risk of dystocia and its consequences increases. estroPLAN has not been sufficiently tested under feedlot conditions; therefore recommendations cannot be made for its use in heifers placed in feedlots.\r\r\n\r\r\n■ Controlled Breeding: The luteolytic action of estroPLAN can be utilized to schedule estrus and ovulation for an individual cycling animal or a group of animals. This allows control of the time at which cycling cows or heifers can be bred. estroPLAN can be incorporated into a controlled breeding program by the following methods:\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Single estroPLAN Injection\r\r\n- Only animals with a mature corpus luteum should be treated to obtain maximum response to the single injection. However, not all cycling cattle should be treated since a mature corpus luteum is present for only 11 to 12 days of the 21-day cycle.\r\r\n- Prior to treatment, cattle should be examined rectally and found to be anatomically normal, be nonpregnant, and have a mature corpus luteum. If these criteria are met, estrus is expected to occur 2 to 5 days following injection, at which time animals may be inseminated. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours postinjection.\r\r\n- With a single injection program, it may be desirable to assess the cyclicity status of the herd before estroPLAN treatment. This can be accomplished by heat detecting and breeding at the usual time following detection of estrus for a 6-day period, all prior to injection. If by the sixth day the cyclicity status appears normal (approximately 25 - 30% detected in estrus), all cattle not already inseminated should be palpated for normality, nonpregnancy, and cyclicity, then injected with estroPLAN. Breeding should then be continued at the usual time following signs of estrus on the seventh and eighth days. On the ninth and tenth days, breeding may continue at the usual time following detection of estrus, or all cattle not already inseminated may be bred either once on the ninth day (at about 72 hours postinjection) or on both the ninth and tenth days (at about 72 and 96 hours postinjection).\r\r\n\r\r\n2. Double estroPLAN Injections\r\r\n- Prior to treatment, cattle should be examined rectally and found to be anatomically normal, nonpregnant, and cycling (the presence of a mature corpus luteum is not necessary when the first injection of a double injection regimen is given). A second injection should be given 11 days after the first injection. In normal, cycling cattle, estrus is expected 2 to 5 days following the second injection. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours following the second estroPLAN injection.\r\r\n- Many animals will come into estrus following the first injection; these animals can be inseminated at the usual time following detected estrus. Animals not inseminated should receive a second injection 11 days after the first injection. Animals receiving both injections may be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus or may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours post second injection.\r\r\n- Any controlled breeding program recommended should be completed by either:\r\r\n● observing animals (especially during the third week after injection) and inseminating or hand mating any animals returning to estrus,\r\r\nOR\r\r\n● turning in clean-up bull(s) 5 to 7 days after the last injection of estroPLAN to cover any animals returning to estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\nREQUIREMENTS FOR CONTROLLED BREEDING PROGRAMS:\r\r\n- A variety of programs can be designed to best meet the needs of individual management systems. A controlled breeding program should be selected which is appropriate for the existing circumstances and management practices.\r\r\n- Before a controlled breeding program is planned, the producer’s objectives must be examined and he must be made aware of the projected results and limitations. The producer and his consulting veterinarian should review the operation’s breeding history, herd health and nutritional status and agree that a controlled breeding program is practical in the producer’s specific situation. For any successful controlled breeding program:\r\r\n● cows and heifers must be normal, nonpregnant, and cycling (rectal palpation should be performed);\r\r\n● cattle must be in a fit and thrifty breeding condition and on an adequate or increasing plane of nutrition;\r\r\n● proper program planning and record keeping are essential;\r\r\n● if artificial insemination is used, it must be performed by competent inseminators using high-quality semen.\r\r\n- It is important to understand that estroPLAN is effective only in animals with a mature corpus luteum (ovulation must have occurred at least 5 days prior to treatment). This must be considered when breeding is intended following a single estroPLAN injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY AND TOXICITY:\r\r\n- At 50 and 100 times the recommended dose, mild side effects may be detected in some cattle. These include increased uneasiness, slight frothing, and milk let-down.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\nestroPLAN should not be administered to a pregnant animal whose calf is not to be aborted.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions\r\r\n- There is no effect on fertility following the single or double dosage regimen when breeding occurs at induced estrus or at 72 and 96 hours posttreatment. Conception rates may be lower than expected in those fixed time breeding programs which omit the second insemination (i.e. the insemination at or near 96 hours). This is especially true if a fixed time insemination is used following a single estroPLAN injection.\r\r\n- As with all parenteral products, careful aseptic techniques should be employed to decrease the possibility of postinjection bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy should be employed at the first sign of infection.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration\r\r\n- Two mL of estroPLAN (500 mcg of cloprostenol) should be administered by INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION for all indications in both beef and dairy cattle.\r\r\n- Discard remaining product 180 days after first use.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Period\r\r\nCattle: Meat: 24 hours, Milk: Zero hours\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS:\r\r\n1.

Oxytocin is secreted by the posterior lobe of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin has its main physiological and pharmacological effects in smooth muscle (induction and increase of contractions) of reproductive organs. At the uterus stimulated by estrogen it induces a change in the spontaneous and irregular contractions, these contractions become synchronized, regular, increased and focused. At the mammary glands, it causes physiological contractions of the myoepithelial cells of the acini in the alveoli and small milk ducts, while by causing relaxation of the sphincter of the teat. Oxytocin has a fast action. Its physiological effects are detected within 20 minutes after injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- In the treatment of primary and secondary uterine inertia.\r\r\n- Uterine prolapse.\r\r\n- Mastitis.\r\r\n- Uterine bleeding.\r\r\n- To initiate lactation for mare, she donkeys, cow, doe, dogs and cats.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nMare, she donkeys, cow, doe, dogs and cats.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n• Administer by deep I.M., S.C. or slowly IV route.\r\r\n\r\r\nCat:\r\r\n- Of active: 2 to 5 IU\r\r\n- Of product: 0.2 to 0.5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nBitch:\r\r\n- Of active: 2-10 IU\r\r\n- Of product: 0.2 to 1 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep, goat, pig:\r\r\n- Of active: 2-10 IU \r\r\n- Of product: 0.2-1 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nCow & mares:\r\r\n- Of active: 10 to 40 IU\r\r\n- Of product: 1 to 4 ml intravenously, cut by a quarter the dose used than that indicated by intramuscular, and slowly injecting diluted in saline at a rate of 1 volume to 10. Start with a low dose (irrespective of the route).\r\r\n\r\r\nRepeat if necessary, administration with a minimum interval of one hour. High doses can be administered to animals in the postpartum period.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose:\r\r\nOverdosage or too frequent administration of oxytocin causes overstimulation of the myometrium and puts the uterus in a state of spasmodic cramps: symptoms of colic, ruptured uterus.\r\r\n\r\r\nAntidotes:\r\r\nIsoxsuprine 0.5 mg / kg, intramuscularly.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions & warnings:\r\r\n- When the product is used to facilitate parturition, cervical dilatation must be confirmed before administration to avoid a risk of fetal death or a possible uterine rupture.\r\r\n- It is advisable to wait 30 to 40 minutes before repeating the injections.\r\r\n- Closely spaced injections may induce uterine tetanization.\r\r\n- The effects of daily doses of 100 IU or more (to facilitate evacuation of milk from infected quarters during the treatment of mastitis in cows.\r\r\n- Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors may reduce the effect of oxytocin on the uterus or mammary gland.

These effects are transient.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide is a particularly safe drug even at dose rates substantially above those normally recommended. In UNIVET MULTIDOSE the recommended dose rate is 11.25 mg.kg-¹. At 33.75 mg.kg–¹, as used in the tolerance trials, there was no clinical or biochemical evidence of toxic effect, even when combined with levamisole. On the basis of the available information, it is clear that while levamisole does not have the safety index of some of the alternative anthelmintics (e.g. the benzimidazoles), its safety is adequate given careful usage and reasonably accurate weight estimation in domestic ruminants. This point is raised on the label and package insert. Its field usage over the years since its first introduction supports this conclusion. Furthermore,where toxic signs have occurred at dose levels two to three times over the recommended level, the signs have been transient with the vast majority of animals showing signs recovering in a few hours at most\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Period(s)\r\r\n- Animals should not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment or for 60 days thereafter.\r\r\n- Cattle: Not authorised for use in cattle producing milk for human consumption, including pregnant cattle intended to produce milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Sheep: Not authorised for use in ewes producing milk for human consumption including during the dry period.

Both LH and FSH have a direct effect on the ovary: FSH stimulates follicle development, while LH induces ovulation and luteinization.\r\r\n- Injection of Ovurelin induces the simultaneous release of FSH and LH thereby stimulating the maturation of ovarian follicles, ovulation and development of the corpus luteum.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n1. Oestrus synchronization: a procedure developed to synchronise Ovulation for timed breeding. Procedures involving a combination of PGF2a/GnRH have been found to be superior in terms of of pregnancy rate and calving to conception intervals in dairy cattle. Using a Combination of PGF2a/GnRH also result in a more precise synchronisation hence allowing fixed-time insemination. Fixed-term insemination in turn allows insemination of large groups of cows together, without the need for oestrus detection.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe PGF2a/GnRH procedure for dairy cattle reproductive management is as follows:\r\r\n(i) Day 0 - GnRH administration: GnRH induces ovulation and luteinisation of dominant follicles present at the time of treatment and causes the smaller follicles to undergo atresia. A new follicular wave is subsequently recruited and a new dominant folicle gradually emerges.\r\r\n(ii) Day 7 - PGF2a administration: 7 days after the first treatment with GnRH, PGF2a is administered. Administration of PGF2a causes luteolysis of the GnRH induced corpus luteum. The new dominant follicle is ready to ovulate 2 -3 days later.\r\r\n(ii) Day 9 - GnRH administration: The second GnRH dose induces an LH surge, which further synchronises the dominant follicle, resulting in ovulation of predictable timing, allowing fixed time insemination8-24 hours later.\r\r\n(iv) Insemination 8 - 24 hours after the second GnRH, regardless of the presence or absence of visible oestrus.\r\r\n\r\r\n2. Treatment of Anoestrus\r\r\n(i) Day 0 - GnRH administration and insertion of P4 device.\r\r\n(ii) Day 7 - PGF2a administration\r\r\n(iii) Day 7 - 9 Al to detected oestrus during next 72 hours.\r\r\n(iv) Day 10 - GnRH administration and Fixed Time Al of all non-bred cows during the next 24 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\n3. Prevention of delayed ovulation\r\r\n- Delayed ovulation can result in the reduction of the rate of conception due to asynchrony between ova and sperm at the time of artificial insemination (Al).\r\r\n- Delayed ovulation can be prevented by the administration of Ovurelin, which stimulates the release of LH and hence induces ovulation.\r\r\n\r\r\n4. Improvement of postpartum fertility\r\r\n- It is important that normal ovarian cyclical activity resume in the early post-partum period to minimise the calving to conception interval or 'days open'.\r\r\n- Ovurelin given in the first 40 days of the postpartum period may initiate the ovarian cyclical activity to resume, and reduce the incidence of postpartum infertility in cows.\r\r\n\r\r\n5. Treatment of cystic ovaries\r\r\n- Cystic ovaries are an infertility problem in dairy cattle, which may be of single or multiple and of follicular or luteal origin.\r\r\n- Clinical signs of ovarian cysts include irregular oestrus cycles, anoestrus and nymphomania. Ovarian cysts can be diagnosed by rectal palpation of the structures on one or both ovaries. Treatment of cystic ovaries with Ovurelin may result in the recommencement of normal cyclical activity, through the response of ovarian cysts to the released LH induced by Ovurelin. Ovurelin given in the first 40 days of the postpartum period may initiate the ovarian cyclical activity to resume, and reduce the incidence of postpartum infertility in cows.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- For intramuscular injection to the anterior half of the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Oestrus synchronisation:\r\r\n- Day 0: 1mL Ovurelin\r\r\n- Day 7: 2mL Ovuprost\r\r\n- Day 9: 1 mL Ovurelin\r\r\n- Insemination 8- 24 hours after 2nd injection of Ovurelin\r\r\n\r\r\n» Treatment of anoestrus:\r\r\n1.

        "description": "COMPOSITION\r\r\nEach 1 ml contains:\r\r\n- Fenbendazole 100 mg\r\r\n- Rafoxanide 100 mg\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Fenbendazole, like many benzimidazoles, blocks fumarate reductase which results in the inhibition of the formation of adenosine triphosphate (involved in mitochondrial energy). There is also evidence that it inhibits glucose uptake and therefore increases glycogen utilization and depletes the worm’s glycogen reserves. The overall effect of this action is to effectively starve the parasite to death. Furthermore this action results in the detachment of the parasites but in the case of intestinal helminths this detachment does not result in loss of contact with the drug whereas in the case of the liver fluke such detachment would reduce such contact. This probably explains its limited effect on the liver fluke and the good effect on intestinal helminths.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide (QP52AG05) is a salicylanilide anthelmintic and these are known to be potent uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation in animal tissues. In vitro experiments indicate that salicylanilides, including the commercially used flukicides, oxyclozanide and rafoxanide, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in Fasciola hepatica and other parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\n- Fenbendazole: is absorbed poorly from the gastro-intestinal tract leading to with low plasma levels of fenbendazole, oxfendazole and sulphone. It is mainly excreted in the faeces though some of the metabolites that have been identified are excreted in the urine and bile. The active and its metabolites are mainly found in the plasma.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide: Kinetic studies of rafoxanide in cattle have shown that it is absorbed into the blood with a mean peak concentration of circa 23 μg.ml-1 achieved in 2 to 3 days. Plasma are considerablyhigher than those in tissues. Only one metabolite has been identified (3, 5-di-iodosalicylic acid) and this was found in blood tissues and milk. There is little known or reported on the excretion of rafoxanide though apparently it is excreted in the bile\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- The product permits a three way activity against Fluke, Lungworms and Stomach Worms in Cattle. It is a broad spectrum anthelmintic for the treatment of benzimidazole susceptible mature and immature stages of nematodes and cestodes of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of cattle. Rafoxanide is active against immature and mature Fasciola sp.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide is active against immature and mature Fasciola hepatica (mature and immature over 8 weeks of age).\r\r\n- Cattle: Haemonchus sp. Ostertagia sp. Trichostrongylus sp. Cooperia sp. Nematodirus sp. Bunostomum sp. Trichuris sp. Strongyloides sp. Oesophagostomum sp. Dictyocaulus sp. Moniezia sp.\r\r\n- Fasciola hepatica (mature and immature over 8 weeks of age).\r\r\n- The product has a good therapeutic effect against type II Ostertagiasis.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\n- Not for use against Benzimidazole resistant nematodes.\r\r\n- Do not use in cases of hypersensitivity to the active substances\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- For oral administration in cattle.\r\r\n- For cattle, the recommended therapeutic dose is (11.25 ml / 100 kg) 11.25 mg fenbendazole and 11.25 mg rafoxanide per kilogram bodyweight.\r\r\n- Shake well before use\r\r\n- Estimate bodyweight carefully.\r\r\n- Use only properly calibrated dosing equipment.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nThe product is well tolerated in cattle at three times the recommended dosage.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Period\r\r\nMeat:\r\r\n- Cattle: 60 days.

The product is also ovicidal against fluke and worm eggs.\r\r\n- Benzimidazoles bind to nematode tubulin, a protein necessary for the formation and viability of microtubules. This occurs primarily in absorptive intestinal cells resulting in the absence of microtubules in the intestinal cells of the nematode, with the result that these cells cannot absorb nutrients, thus causing a consequent reduction in glycogen and effective starvation of the parasites. Structural differences have been shown to exist between tubulin from mammalian and helminth sources, resulting in the preferential toxicity of albendazole to the helminth and not to the host.\r\r\n- Benzimidazoles have also been shown to inhibit the fumurate reductase system of helminths and impair energy production\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle and Sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Tramazole 10% is a broad spectrum multi-purpose anthelmintic for the control of mature and developing immature forms of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, tapeworms and adult liver fluke in cattle and sheep.

It works by blocking the bacteria's ribosomes, which are the parts of the cells where proteins are produced, and consequently inhibiting the growth of bacteria. Gamithromycin was developed for non-lactating cattle for the treatment and prevention of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- For use in cattle for therapeutic treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n- The presence of the disease in the herd should be established before preventative treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nBovine (non lactating).\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Of product: A single subcutaneous injection of 1 ml / 25 kg body weight in the neck.\r\r\n- For treatment of cattle over 250 kg body weight, divide the dose so that no more than 10 ml are injected at one site.\r\r\n- To ensure correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid under dosing.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications & Warnings:\r\r\n- Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics or to any of the excipients.\r\r\n- Cross-resistance may occur with other macrolides. Avoid simultaneous administration of antimicrobials with a similar mode of action such as other macrolides or lincosamides.\r\r\n- During clinical trials no treatment-related abnormalities were observed except some transient injection site swellings. Visible injection site swellings may develop in up to 45% of treated animals associated with occasional, slight pain evident for one day. The swellings typically resolve within 3 to 14 days but may persist in some animals for up to 35 days after treatment.\r\r\n- Clinical studies have demonstrated the wide margin of safety for gamithromycin injection in cattle. In a young adult cattle study, gamithromycin was administered by subcutaneous injection at 6, 18 and 30 mg/kg (1, 3 and 5 times the recommended dose) and repeated three times at 0, 5 and 10 days (three times the recommended duration of use). Injection site reactions were noted in a dose-related manner.\r\r\n- Based on laboratory animal data, gamithromycin has not produced any evidence of selective developmental or reproductive effects. The safety of gamithromycin during pregnancy and lactation has not been evaluated in cattle. Use only according to the risk/ benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 64 days.\r\r\n- Not authorized for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Do not use in pregnant cows or heifers, which are intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Condition:\r\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30°C, and used after opening for one month to be stored at a temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf-life:\r\r\n- Before opening: 3 years.\r\r\n- From first opening: One month.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nCarton box containing colorless transparent glass (Type II) vial 50 ml injectable solution closed with chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Type I) and aluminum cap with label and insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nADWIA Co.

        "description": "Anthelmintic (Benzimidazole)\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\r\n- Fenbendazole 50 mg/ml\r\r\n\r\r\n- Fenbendazole is an anthelmintic belonging to the benzimidazole group which acts by blocking fumerate reductase which\r\r\nresults in the inhibition of the formation of adenosine triphosphate(involved in mitochondrial energy).\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Fenbendazole, like many benzimidazoles, blocks fumarate reductase which results in the inhibition of the formation of adenosine triphosphate (involved in mitochondrial energy). There is also evidence that it inhibits glucose uptake and therefore increases glycogen utilization and depletes the worm’s glycogen reserves. The overall effect of this action is to effectively starve the parasite to death. Furthermore this action results in the detachment of the parasites but in the case of intestinal helminths this detachment does not result in loss of contact with the drug whereas in the case of the liver fluke such detachment would reduce such contact. This probably explains its limited effect on the liver fluke and the good effect on intestinal helminths.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\nFenbendazole is poorly soluble in water and consequentlyis poorly absorbed; something which is reflected in the relatively low plasma levels. The scheme for the known metabolic pathways is given by Short, Flory, Hsieh and Barker (1988) together with the relative rates of breakdown in various species. The main break down products are the sulphoxide (oxfendazole) and sulphone.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle and Sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\nA broad spectrum anthelmintic for control of benzimidazole susceptible mature and developing immature forms of the nematodes of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of cattle and sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Cattle & Sheep infected with benzimidazole susceptible nematodes: Haemonchus spp. Ostertagia spp. Trichostrongylus spp. Cooperia spp. Nematodirus spp. Bunostomum spp. Trichuris spp. Strongyloides spp. Oesophagostomum spp. Dictyocaulus viviparus. \r\r\n- Curazole is usually effective against Moniezia spp. of tapeworm and inhibited larvae of Ostertagia spp. in cattle.\r\r\n- Curazole is usually effective against Moniezia spp. of tapeworm and may have useful but variable efficacy against Trichuris spp. in sheep.\r\r\n\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- For oral administration in cattle and sheep.\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n- Cattle: 7.5 mg of fenbendazole per kg (approximately 5 ml per 33 kg)\r\r\n- Sheep: 5 mg of fenbendazole per kg (approximately 1 ml per 10 kg)\r\r\n- Estimate bodyweight carefully.

NSAID have the potential to relieve pain and inflammation without the immunosuppressive and metabolic side effects associated with corticosteroids. However, all NSAID have the potential for other adverse effects that should be considered in the overall management of the inflammatory process.\r\r\n» Generally, the classification NSAID is applied to drugs that inhibit one or more steps in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA). Unlike corticosteroids, which inhibit numerous pathways, NSAID act primarily to reduce the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PG) by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX). In general, NSAID do not inhibit lipoxygenase (and hence leukotriene) formation, or the formation of other inflammatory mediators, although tepoxalin, a recently introduced NSAID does inhibit lipoxygenase.\r\r\n» All NSAID are antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory. They are used for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarhritis, colic, navicular disease and laminitis in horses.\r\r\n» NSAID provide only symptomatic relief from pain and inflammation and do not significantly alter the Course of pathologic damage. As analgesics, they are generally less potent than opioids and are therefore more effective against mild to moderate pain.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n» Horse:\r\r\n- Relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, colic, navicular disease and laminitis.\r\r\n- Relaxation of intestinal spasm.\r\r\n- Gentle stimulation of peristalsis in colic and in acute dilatation of the stomach.\r\r\n- Calm animal during examination or treatment.\r\r\n- In lumbago and tetanus (combined with tetanus antiserum).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Dogs and cats:\r\r\n- Relief of pain in colic and other spastic conditions of the abdominal organs.\r\r\n- Acute and chronic arthritis.\r\r\n- Rheumatic conditions of muscle and joints.\r\r\n- Neuritis, neuralgia and tendovaginitis.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget animals:\r\r\nhorse, dogs and cats\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- By intravenous or deep intramuscular\r\r\n» Horse: 20 ml maximum\r\r\n» Dogs and cats: 0.6 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n- Not used in food producing animals.\r\r\n- Do not inject subcutaneously since this may cause tissue irritation.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautions:\r\r\n- Maintain hydration and renal perfusion in animal receiving NSAID, especially those undergoing anesthesia or surgery.\r\r\n- The hemocytologic condition of the animal should be monitored when prolonged periods of use of NSAID.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects: GIT ulceration\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\n- Store at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n- After opening use within 28 days and store at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nCarton box contains brown glass bottle type II containing 100 ml Injectable solution with chlorobutyl rubber closure & aluminium cap, with outer label and an inner pamphlet.\r\r\n\r\r\nALEXANDRIA Co.

There is also evidence that it inhibits glucose uptake and therefore increases glycogen utilization and depletes the worm’s glycogen reserves. The overall effect of this action is to effectively starve the parasite to death. Furthermore this action results in the detachment of the parasites but in the case of intestinal helminths this detachment does not result in loss of contact with the drug whereas in the case of the liver fluke such detachment would reduce such contact. This probably explains its limited effect on the liver fluke and the good effect on intestinal helminths.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide (QP52AG05) is a salicylanilide anthelmintic and these are known to be potent uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation in animal tissues. In vitro experiments indicate that salicylanilides, including the commercially used flukicides, oxyclozanide and rafoxanide, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in Fasciola hepatica and other parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\n- Fenbendazole: is absorbed poorly from the gastro-intestinal tract leading to with low plasma levels of fenbendazole, oxfendazole and sulphone. It is mainly excreted in the faeces though some of the metabolites that have been identified are excreted in the urine and bile. The active and its metabolites are mainly found in the plasma.\r\r\n- Rafoxanide: Kinetic studies of rafoxanide in cattle have shown that it is absorbed into the blood with a mean peak concentration of circa 23 μg.ml-1 achieved in 2 to 3 days. Plasma are considerablyhigher than those in tissues. Only one metabolite has been identified (3, 5-di-iodosalicylic acid) and this was found in blood tissues and milk. There is little known or reported on the excretion of rafoxanide though apparently it is excreted in the bile\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle & Sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- Curafluke 5% Oral Drench permits a three way activity against Fluke, Lungworms and Stomach Worms in Cattle and Sheep.

It appears that imidocarb acts directly on the parasite, causing alteration in number and size of nuclei and in morphology (vacuolation) of the cytoplasm. The antiprotozoan activity is derived from the carbanilide acting on glycolyis of the parasite. This is the result of this class of drugs giving rise to hypoglycaemia in the host. Babesia as well as many other parasites like trypanosomes depend upon host glucose for aerobic glycolysis. There is also a selective blocking effect on the replication of the quinetoplastic DNA of the parasite.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Cattle: For the treatment of Redwater fever (babesiosis) caused by B. bigemina and B. bovis.\r\r\n- Dogs: For the treatment of Redwater fever (babesiosis) caused by B. canis, B. vogeli and B. rossi.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle and Dogs\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n- The product is for S/C injection administration only.\r\r\n- Cattle: 1.0 ml / 100 kg as a single dose\r\r\n- Dogs: 0.25 ml / 10 kg as a single dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\n- Imidocarb is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor. The dosage varies according to the species and the desired purpose. In all cases, it must be strictly adapted to the weight of the animal.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions for humans:\r\r\n- Do not use if under medical advice not to work with compounds which may exhibit anti-cholinesterase activity.\r\r\n- Wash splashes of the product off the skin and eyes immediately.

Although the exact mode of action of the drug is not known, a possible mechanism is interference with cellular repair and replication through binding with DNA. Imidocarb is highly effective against infections caused by Babesia and Anaplasma spp.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Babesiosis, also known as tick fever or redwater, is caused by tick-borne protozoal parasites of the genus Babesia. Babesiosis is characterised by fever, anaemia, icterus and haemoglobinuria. It is a widespread disease most common in tropical regions where the cattle tick Rhipicephalus(Boophilus) decoloratus and Rhipicepha/us (Boophilus) microplus is abundant. The most significant parasites causing Babesiosis in cattle are Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina.\r\r\n- In endemic areas infection with Babesia is acquired by calves at a young age but infection does not manifest as clinical disease due to natural resistance. Animals infected early act as carriers of infection, remaining immune to clinical disease as long as infection persists.   Re-infection constantly occurs in endemic areas. Without re-infection, immunity is lost within several  months and clinical disease results.\r\r\n\r\r\nClinical disease most commonly occurs when:\r\r\n- susceptible cattle are transported from a non-endemic to an endemic region.\r\r\n- contact occurs between infected and non-infected cattle.\r\r\n- epidemics occur following introduction of infection to non-endemic areas or sudden increases in tick populations where environmental conditions are favourable.\r\r\n- the tick vector population drops due to altered weather patterns or tick control measures reducing re-infection rate and therefore immunity.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Treatment of clinical cases of Babesiosis with Imidox® is most effective when cattle are treated early in the course of the disease and in combination with supportive therapy such as provision of shade.\r\r\n- Where disease is severe, repeat treatment with Imidox® may be required after 24 hours.\r\r\n- Sterilization of infection with Imidox® results in complete elimination of Babesial parasites from carrier animals. Elimination of carriers is necessary where movement of cattle from an endemic to a non-endemic area would otherwise result in infection of susceptible cattle.\r\r\n- Prevention of Babesia infection may be achieved by treatment of susceptible animals with Imidox® prior to introduction into an endemic area.  Over time the level of imidocarb in the animal's body diminishes, allowing a small number of parasites to establish infection while the animal is still protected by the drug.  The result is the development of immunity to disease without the occurrence of clinical signs. However if there is no exposure to infection during the period of weaning imidocarb levels, the animal will become susceptible to clinical disease. One dose of Imidox® will provide protection from infection for up to 4 weeks.  Imidox® is useful for the protection against Babesiosis where a short passage through an endemic area is planned for a herd of susceptible cattle.  Outbreaks of Babesiosis may be controlled by administration of preventative doses of Imidox® to all animals exposed to infection, however vaccination will still be necessary at a later time.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the rickettsial organism Anaplasma marginalewhich parasitisises red blood cells. The course of the disease may be prolonged over months. The severity of disease resulting from infection tends to increase with age, reaching up to 50 % mortality in susceptible adult cattle.\r\r\n- The clinical signs of Anaplasmosis relate to the acute anaemia that results and include fever, jaundice and emaciation. Decreased milk production and abortion are common. The clinical signs of Anaplasmosis and Babesiosis are very similar, however the dose rate for their treatment differs. It is therefore important to prepare blood smears from suspect cases for laboratory examination in order to distinguish between them.\r\r\n- Imidox® is an effective treatment for Anaplasmosis at the recommended dose rate. Supportive therapy should be instituted including provision of shade and plenty of feed and water. In severe cases blood transfusion may be required. Recovered animals should be monitored for approximately 4 weeks following treatment, as re- treatment may be necessary if relapse occurs.\r\r\n- To reduce risk of transmission of the disease the herd should be dipped several times for tick control.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS\r\r\n- Do not slaughter for human consumption within 213 days of last treatment.\r\r\n- Do not use in lactating cows where milk or milk products may be used for human consumption.

This equates to 60 mg/kg Sulphadiazine, 10 mg/kg Neomycin and 42 mg/kg Kaolin twice daily.\r\r\n- The maximum period of treatment is 5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nAnimals intended for human consumption must not be slaughtered during treatment. Calves intended for human consumption may only be slaughtered after 28 days from the last treatment. Not intended for animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in animals with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredients. Do not exceed the recommended dosage or the period of treatment.\r\r\n- Do not use local anaesthetics of the procaine group during treatment as they are antagonistic to the sulphonamide component.\r\r\n- Do not use in calves with functional rumens. Do not use in lactating cows.\r\r\n- Do not use in foals and horses.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\nConcurrent intravenous fluid therapy should be considered in dehydrated calves. Parenteral antibiotic treatment should be considered if a clinical response is not seen after 48 hours treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE PERSON\r\r\n- Avoid contact with skin. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Chronic usage of oral neomycin may result in bacterial or fungal superinfections.\r\r\n\r\r\nUSE DURING PREGNANCY OR LACTATION\r\r\n- The product is intended for use in calves only. Do not use in lactating cows.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\n- There is interaction and antagonism between sulphonamides and the Vitamin B Complex. Do not use local anaesthetics of the procaine group during treatment, as they are antagonistic to the sulphonamide component.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nGood tolerance has been confirmed in calves at x3 and x5 the recommended dose rate.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Sulphadiazine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. It acts by interfering with the biosynthesis of folic acid in bacterial cells, competitively preventing para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) from incorporation into the folic acid molecule. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed to all tissues and body fluids. The sulphonamides are eliminated by a combination of renal excretion and biotransformation.\r\r\n- Neomycin is the isomeric mixture of Neomycin B and C. It has a rapid dose related bactericidal action on susceptible microorganisms. The antibacterial action is directed primarily against aerobic gram-negative bacteria. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has a short life and is nearly all excreted unchanged in the faeces.\r\r\n- Kaolin is a standard long-established adsorbent in human and veterinary medicine.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 18 months.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE\r\r\n250 ML, 1 L",

Due to the effect thiamazole can have on reducing the glomerular filtration rate, the effect of therapy on renal function should be monitored closely as deterioration of an underlying condition may occur.\r\r\n- Haematology must be monitored due to risk of leucopenia or haemolytic anaemia.\r\r\n- Any animal that suddenly appears unwell during therapy, particularly if they are febrile, should have a blood sample taken for routine haematology and biochemistry. \r\r\n- Neutropenic animals (neutrophil counts <2.5 x 10^9/l) should be treated with prophylactic bactericidal antibacterial drugs and supportive therapy.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor use in person\r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n- In the case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician.\r\r\n- Thiamazole may cause vomiting, epigastric distress, headache, fever, arthralgia, pruritus and pancytopaenia. Treatment is symptomatic.\r\r\n- Wash hands with soap and water after handling litter used by treated animals.\r\r\n- Do not eat, drink or smoke while handling the tablet or used litter.\r\r\n- Do not handle this product if you are allergic to antithyroid products. If allergic symptoms develop, such as a skin rash, swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty in breathing, you should seek medical attention immediately and show the package leaflet or label to the doctor. \r\r\n- Do not break or crush tablets.\r\r\n- As thiamazole is a suspected human teratogen, women of child-bearing age and pregnant women should wear gloves when handling litter of treated cats.\r\r\n- Pregnant women should wear gloves when handling the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Adverse reactions have been reported following long term control of hyperthyroidism. \r\r\n- In many cases, signs may be mild and transitory and not a reason for withdrawal of treatment. The more serious effects are mainly reversible when medication is stopped. \r\r\n- Adverse reactions are uncommon. The most common clinical side effects that are reported include vomiting, inappetance/anorexia, lethargy, severe pruritus and excoriations of the head and neck, bleeding diathesis and icterus associated with hepatopathy, and haematological abnormalities (eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, neutropenia, lymphopenia, slight leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or haemolytic anaemia). These side effects resolve within 7-45 days after cessation of thiamazole therapy. \r\r\n- Possible immunological side effects include anaemia, with rare side effects including thrombocytopenia and serum anti-nuclear antibodies, and, very rarely, lymphadenopathy can occur. Treatment should be stopped immediately and alternative therapy considered following a suitable period for recovery. \r\r\n- Following long-term treatment with thiamazole in rodents, an increased risk of neoplasia in the thyroid gland has been shown to occur, but no evidence is available in cats.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nLaboratory studies in rats and mice have shown evidence of teratogenic and embryotoxic effects of thiamazole. The safety of the product was not assessed in pregnant or lactating cats. Do not use in pregnant or lactating females.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\n- Concurrent treatment with phenobarbital may reduce the clinical efficacy of thiamazole.\r\r\n- Thiamazole is known to reduce the hepatic oxidation of benzimidazole wormers and may lead to increases in their plasma concentrations when given concurrently.\r\r\n- Thiamazole is immunomodulatory, therefore this should be taken into account when considering vaccination programmes.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- For oral administration only.\r\r\n- For the stabilisation of feline hyperthyroidism prior to surgical thyroidectomy and for the long term treatment of feline hyperthyroidism, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg per day.\r\r\n- Wherever possible, the total daily dose should be divided into two and administered morning and evening. Tablets should not be split. \r\r\n- If, for reasons of compliance, once daily dosing with a 5 mg tablet is preferable, then this is acceptable although the 2.5 mg tablet given twice daily may be more efficacious in the short term. The 5 mg tablet is also suitable for cats requiring higher dose rates.\r\r\n- Haematology, biochemistry and serum total T4 should be assessed before initiating treatment and after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months. At each of the recommended monitoring intervals, the dose should be titrated to effect according to the total T4 and to clinical response to treatment. Dose adjustments should be made in increments of 2.5 mg and the aim should be to achieve the lowest possible dose rate. \r\r\n- If more than 10 mg per day is required animals should be monitored particularly carefully.\r\r\n- The dose administered should not exceed 20 mg/day.\r\r\n- For long term treatment of hyperthyroidism, the animal should be treated for life\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\n- In tolerance studies in young healthy cats, the following dose-related clinical signs occurred at doses of up to 30 mg/animal/day: anorexia, vomiting, lethargy, pruritus and haematological and biochemical abnormalities such as neutropenia, lymphopenia, reduced serum potassium and phosphorus levels, increased magnesium and creatinine levels and the occurrence of anti-nuclear antibodies. At a dose of 30 mg/day some cats showed signs of haemolytic anaemia and severe clinical deterioration. Some of these signs may also occur in hyperthyroid cats treated at doses of up to 20 mg per day.\r\r\n- Excessive doses in hyperthyroid cats may result in signs of hypothyroidism. This is however unlikely, as hypothyroidism is usually corrected by negative feedback mechanisms.\r\r\n- If overdosage occurs, stop treatment and give symptomatic and supportive care.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nNot applicable.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithyroid preparations: sulphur-containing imidazole derivatives.\r\r\n- ATC Vet Code: QH03BB02.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\nThiamazole acts by blocking the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone in vivo. The primary action is to inhibit binding of iodide to the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, thereby preventing the catalysed iodination of thyroglobulin and T3 and T4 synthesis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PARTICULARS\r\r\n- Following oral dosing in healthy cats, thiamazole is rapidly and completely absorbed with a bioavailability of >75 %. However, there is a considerable variation between animals. Elimination of the drug from cat plasma is rapid with a half life of 4.5-5.0 hours. Peak plasma levels occur approximately 1-2 hours after dosing. Cmax is between 1.6-1.9 μg/ml.\r\r\n- In rats thiamazole has been shown to be poorly bound to plasma protein (5 %); 40 % was bound to red blood cells. The metabolism of thiamazole in cats has not been investigated, however, in rats thiamazole is rapidly metabolised in the thyroid gland. \r\r\n- About 64 % of the administered dose being eliminated in the urine and only 7.8 % excreted in faeces. This is in contrast with man where the liver is important for the metabolic degradation of the compound. The drug residence time in the thyroid gland is assumed to be longer than in the plasma.\r\r\n- From man and rats it is known that the drug can cross the placenta and concentrates in the foetal thyroid gland. There is also a high rate of transfer into breast milk.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- Tablet container: Shelf life of the veterinary medicinal product as packaged for sale: 5 years.\r\r\n- Blister: Shelf life of the veterinary medicinal product as packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Do not store above 25C.\r\r\n- Tablet container: Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture. \r\r\n- Keep the container in the outer carton.\r\r\n- Blister: Keep the blister strips in the carton.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- Tablet container: White polypropylene tub with white polyethylene tamper evident lid containing 100 tablets. \r\r\n- Blister: Transparent PVC/Aclar – aluminium blister.

The product is also ovicidal against fluke and worm eggs.\r\r\n- Benzimidazoles bind to nematode tubulin, a protein necessary for the formation and viability of microtubules. This occurs primarily in absorptive intestinal cells resulting in the absence of microtubules in the intestinal cells of the nematode, with the result that these cells cannot absorb nutrients, thus causing a consequent reduction in glycogen and effective starvation of the parasites. Structural differences have been shown to exist between tubulin from mammalian and helminth sources, resulting in the preferential toxicity of albendazole to the helminth and not to the host.\r\r\n- Benzimidazoles have also been shown to inhibit the fumurate reductase system of helminths and impair energy production\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species: Cattle and Sheep.\r\r\n\r\nIndications:\r\n- Tramazole 2.5% is a broad spectrum multi-purpose anthelmintic for the control of mature and developing immature forms of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, tapeworms and adult liver fluke in cattle and sheep.

It acts by inhibition of DNA-gyrase. Its spectrum is broad, directed towards Gram positive (especially Staphylococcus), Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella spp.) and Mycoplasma (Mycoplasma bovis and M. hyopneumoniae).\r\r\n\r\r\n• Pharmacokinetic particulars:\r\r\n- After subcutaneous or intramuscular administration at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg in cattle and pigs, Marbofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and reaches maximal plasmatic concentrations of 1,5 μg/ml in less than one hour. Bioavailability is close to 100 %.\r\r\n- Marbofloxacin is slightly related to plasmatic proteins (less than 10 % in the pig and less than 30 % in cattle) and is widely distributed in the entire organism. In the majority of tissues (liver, kidney, skin, lung, uterus), tissular concentrations are higher than those of plasma.\r\r\n- Marbofloxacin is slowly eliminated in the pre-ruminant calf (t1/2 = 5-9 hours) and in the pig (t1/2 = 8-10 hours), more rapidly in the ruminant cattle (t1/2 = 4-7 hours), and mainly in active form in the urines and faeces.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- Disorders caused by germs sensitive to Marbofloxacin.\r\r\n• In calves and young cattle: Treatment of respiratory infections with strains sensitive to Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis.\r\r\n• In pigs: Treatment of respiratory infections with strains sensitive to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Control the sensitivity of strains prior to use the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdministration and usage\r\r\n• Calves, young cattle: IV, IM, SC routes. 2 mg of Marbofloxacin per kg (i.e. 1 ml for 10 kg of b.w.) in a daily injection by IM or SC route for 3 - 5 days. First injection can also be made by IV route.\r\r\n• Pigs: IM route. 2 mg of Marbofloxacin per kg (i.e. 1 ml for 10 kg of b.w.) in a daily injection for 3 - 5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings\r\r\n• Use during pregnancy and lactation:\r\r\n- Studies in the animals of laboratory (rat, rabbit) have not produced any evidence of a teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effect of Marbofloxacin.\r\r\n- Harmlessness of the product in the pregnant sow has not been shown. However, it can be apparently used in pregnant females without any particular inconvenience.\r\r\n- Harmlessness in suckling pigs during use of the product in the sow has been shown.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Overdose:\r\r\n- No sign of overdose has been shown with the product after administration of 3 times the recommended dose.\r\r\n- In the case of overdose with Marbofloxacin, acute neurological signs occur whose treatment is symptomatic.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-indication\r\r\nDo not administer in the case of bacterial infections with bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\n• Calves and young cattle:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 6 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Pigs Meat and offal: 4 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nCategory\r\r\nList I.\r\r\nPrescription only medicine.

It binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels. The macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\nAfter oral administration of the recommended doses to horses, the following parameters were observed: Cmax of 48.79 ng/ml, Tmax of 5.5 hours, elimination half-life of 61 hours. Ivermectin is eliminated primarily via the faeces.\r\r\n\r\r\nPosology\r\r\n- A single administration of 200 μg ivermectin per kg of bodyweight.\r\r\n- Each syringe division mark plunger delivers enough paste to treat 100 kg of bodyweight (which corresponds to 1.07 g of product and 20 mg of ivermectin).\r\r\n- The syringe containing 6.42 g of paste delivers sufficient paste to treat 600 kg of bodyweight at the recommended dose range.\r\r\n- The syringe containing 7.49 g of paste delivers sufficient paste to treat 700 kg of bodyweight at the recommended dose range.\r\r\n\r\r\nDirections for use\r\r\n- Horse weight should be accurately determined for the correct use of the paste. The animal's mouth should be free of food. The syringe must be positioned between the front and back teeth and the paste must be placed on the base of the horse’s tongue. Immediately elevate the head of the horse for a few seconds to ensure deglutition.\r\r\n- Re-treatment should be done according to the epidemiological situation, but not at\r\r\nless than 30 days interval.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for animals\r\r\n- Avermectins may not be well tolerated in all non-target species (cases of intolerance with fatal outcome are reported in dogs, especially Collies, Old English Sheepdogs and related breeds or crosses, and also in turtles/tortoises).\r\r\n- As ivermectin is extremely dangerous to fish and aquatic life treated animals should not have direct access to surface water and ditches during treatment. Parasite resistance to any particular class of anthelmintic may develop following frequent, repeated use of an anthelmintic of that class. Since ivermectin is highly bound to plasma proteins, special care should be taken in cases of sick animals or in nutritional conditions associated with low plasma protein levels.\r\r\n- As with all anthelmintics, a veterinary surgeon should establish appropriate dosing programs and stock management to achieve adequate parasite control and reduce the likelihood of anthelmintic resistance.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings\r\r\n- Strategies that should be avoided because they might lead to an increased risk of development of resistance to anthelmintic drugs include:\r\r\n• Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class over an extended period of time.\r\r\n• Underdosing, which may be due to underestimation of body weight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device (if any).\r\r\n- Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests. Where the results of the test(s) strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n- Resistance to ivermectin has been reported in Parascaris equorum in horses. Therefore the use of this product should be based on local (regional, farm) epidemiological information about susceptibility of nematodes and recommendations on how to limit further selection for resistance to anthelmintics.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 6 months.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\n- Do not store above 30°C.\r\r\n- Store in the original packaging.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nMild transitory signs (slowed pupillary light response and depression) have been seen at a higher dose of 1.8 mg/kg (9 times the recommended dose level). Other signs seen at higher doses include mydriasis, ataxia, tremors, stupor, coma and death. The less severe signs have been transitory. Although no antidote has been identified, symptomatic therapy may be beneficial.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)\r\r\n- Some horses carrying heavy infection of Onchocerca microfilariae havenexperienced reactions with swelling and itching following dosing, assumed to be the result of death of large numbers of microfilariae.\r\r\n- These signs resolve within a few days but symptomatic treatment may be advisable.\r\r\n\r\r\nUse during pregnancy, lactation or lay\r\r\n- Can be used in pregnant mares.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteraction\r\r\n- The effects of GABA agonists are increased by ivermectin.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period(s)\r\r\n- Meat and offal : 30 days.\r\r\n- Do not use in mares producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\n- The product is presented in 6.42 g or 7.49 g plastic syringes made from polyethylene and graduated in 100 kg body weight graduations.\r\r\n\r\r\n- 6.42 g syringe: Box of 1, 2, 12, 40 or 48 syringes, Transparent PVC blister sealed onto a carton sheet containing one syringe\r\r\n\r\r\n- 7.49 g syringe: Box of 1, 2, 12, 40 or 48 syringes, Transparent PVC blister sealed onto a carton sheet containing one syringe\r\r\n\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.",

These effects can include increased tone of intestinal and skeletal musculature, stimnulation of salivary and sweat glands, bronchoconstriction, ureter constricion, miosis and bradycardia.\r\r\n- Neostigmine also has a direct cholinomimetic effect on skeletal muscles.\r\r\n- In horses, neostigmine may decrease jejunal activity and delay gastric emptying. lts use in treating colon impactions and ileus is Controversial delay emptying the bladder.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nNeostigmine is indicated for rumen atony, initiating peristalsis which causes evacuation of the bowel, emptying the bladder and stimulating skeletal muscle contraction in cattle, horses, sheep and swine\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\ncattle, horses, sheep, and swine\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Cattle, sheep and horses: 2 ml / 45 kg by SC injection.\r\r\n- Swine: 4-6 ml / 45 kg B.Wt. by IM injection\r\r\n- These doses may be repeated as indicated.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nThe drug is contraindicated in:\r\r\n- In animals with peritonitis.\r\r\n- Mechanical, intestinal or urinary obstruction.\r\r\n- Late pregnancy.\r\r\n- In animals hypersensitive to this class of compounds, or treated with other cholinesterase inhibitors.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions & Warnings:\r\r\n- Use neostigmine with caution in animals with epilepsy, peptic ulcer disease, bronchial asthma, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, vagotonia, or megacolon.\r\r\n- Atropine will antagonize the muscarinic effects of neostigmne and some clinicians routinely use the two together, but concurrent use should be used cautiously as atropine can mask the early clinical signs of cholinergic crisis.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse effects\r\r\n- Due to its cardiovascular and vascular effects, neostigmine can adversely affect an unstable circulation situation.\r\r\n- The vagal tonus increased by neostigmine can also have a curative effect for the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibilations) and blockages (atrioventricular black).\r\r\n- There are occasional appearances ot restlessness.\r\r\n- When overdose, muscle weakness, diarrhea, miosis, bronchospasm, bradycardia and circulatory collapse occur.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period:\r\r\nNot for use in animais producing milk.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Condition:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceedino 30°C away from light and use after opening for 3 months to be stored at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nCarton box containing amber glass vial (Type II) containing 100 ml injectable solution closed with chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Type I) stopper and sealed with aluminum cap with label + an insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nADWIA Co.

        "description": "Anthelmintic (Benzimidazole)\r\r\n\r\r\nComposition:\r\r\nEach 100 ml Contains:\r\r\n- Triclabendazole 10 gm\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties:\r\r\n- Triclabendazole differs from other benzimidazoles in that is a narrow spectrum anthelmintic. The drug accumulates significantly in both immature and adult stages of Fasciola hepatica and stimulates the major routes of the parasite's energy generating system. As demonstrated by glucose derived acetate and propionate formation. However, under these conditions the parasite's motility decreased, indicating that the drug is not associated with inhibition of the energy generating pathways. Triclabendazole inhibits colchicine binding to microtubular proteins suggesting interference of the drug with microtubular structure and function. The drug strongly inhibits the release of proteolytic enzymes in immature and adult parasites, a process dependent on microtubular functions.\r\r\n- The precise molecular mode of action of this faciolicidal drug remains to be elucidated. 50-75 % of the orally administered dose of triclabendazole is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Very rapidly, absorbed triclabendazole is almost completely oxidized to its sulfoxide and sulfone.\r\r\n- In cattle, triclabendazole sulfoxide reaches peak concentrations approximately 27 hours after administration of the product and the sulfone reaches peak concentrations 64 to 72 hours after administration.\r\r\n- In sheep, triclabendazole sulfoxide reaches peak concentrations approximately 20 hours after administration of the product and the sulfone reaches peak concentrations 30 to 32 hours after administration.\r\r\n- Both metabolites bind strongly to plasma proteins, particularly albumin.\r\r\n- Metabolites are excreted via the bile mainly as conjugates. More than 90% - 95% of the total dose of triclabendazole is excreted in the feces. About 2% in the urine and less than 1% in the milk. The eliminations is virtually complete by 10 days after administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nFor the treatment of adult, immature and early immature stages of liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) susceptible to triclabendazole.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle & sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nDose and administration:\r\r\n- Cattle: 6 ml per 50 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n- Sheep: 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf animals are to be treated collectively rather than individually, they should be grouped according to their bodyweight and dosed accordingly, in order to avoid under – or overdosing. The timing for re-treatment should be based on epidemiological risk patterns and should be customized for each individual farm. To avoid the potential for the accumulation of resides following repeat administration of the product; animals should not be treated with a frequency of less than 10 weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose:\r\r\nA single oral dose of 150-200 mg triclabendazole /Kg of live bodyweight may lead to side effects such as unsteady gait, dullness and reduced appetite, These side effects are slight and last 1 to 5 days. An antidote is not known.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nDo not use in animals known to be hypersensitive to the substance.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & precautions:\r\r\nFor each target species:\r\r\n• Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy: - Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time. - Underdosing, which may be due to underestimation of body weight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device.\r\r\n• Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the test(s) strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n• Resistance to triclabendazolehas been reported in Fasciola hepatica in cattle and sheep.Therefore, the use of this product should be based on local (regional, farm) epidemiological information about susceptibility of the Fasciola hepatica and recommendations on how to limit further selection for resistance to anthelmintics.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor use in animals:\r\r\n• Care should be taken when dosing animals to avoid causing injury to the mouth and pharynx.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor the person:\r\r\n• When using, do not eat, drink or smoke.\r\r\n• Wash splashes from eyes and skin immediately.\r\r\n• Take off immediately any contaminated clothing.\r\r\n• Wash hands and exposed skin before meals and after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther precautions:\r\r\n• The use of this product may have harmful effects on fish and aquatic invertebrates.\r\r\n• Cattle must not have any access to the surface water such as streams, ponds or ditches within 7 days after treatment.\r\r\n• When spreading manure from treated animals on arable lands, a safety distance of 10m to adjacent surface waters must be kept.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions: None known.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects:\r\r\nOccasionally inflammation of the unpigmented skin, including the udder and the teats may occur after treatment in cattle exposed to intense sunshine.\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy, lactation or lay:\r\r\nThe product is safe for use during pregnancy and lactation. However, the product is not permitted for use during lactation in animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- Cattle and sheep (meat and offal): 56 days.\r\r\n- Cattle and sheep (milk): not permitted for use in animals producing milk for human consumption, including pregnant animals intended to produce milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30C, away from direct sunlight.

Penicillin G is highly susceptible to beta- lactamases and has little activity against organisms that can produce these enzymes.\r\r\n- In addition, penicillin G is ineffective against bacteria that are resistant by certain other mechanisms, such as having a relatively impermeable cell wall.\r\r\n- Therefore, penicillin G has little activity against many staphylococci and most gram-negative bacteria.\r\r\n- The penicillins produce their bactericidal effect by inhibiting cross-linkages during bacterial cell wall synthesis.\r\r\n- Pencillin G must penetrate the cell wall to attach to specific proteins on the inner surface of the bacterial cell membrane.\r\r\n- In actively growing cells, the binding of penicillin within the cell wall leads to interference with production of cell wall peptidoglycans and subsequent lysis of the cell in a hypo-or iso-osmotic environment.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- AVISTREP is indicated for use against infections caused by organisms susceptible to Penicillin or Streptomycin, which includes:\r\r\n- Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp. Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Listeria spp, and Salmonella spp.\r\r\n- AVISTREP is effective in the treatment of both local and systemic diseases caused by susceptible organisms including:\r\r\n- Urogenital tract infections, respiratory tract infections e.g. pneumonia, listeriosis, meningitis, septicaemia, enteritis caused by Salmonella spp., toxaemia associated with mastitis, salmonellosis, Strangles, and the control of secondary bacterial infections.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration\r\r\n- The dose should be given once daily by deep intramuscular injection for up to three consecutive days.\r\r\n- Cattle, Horses, Sheep, Goats, Dog and Cat: 1 ml AVISTREP per 25 kg b. wt., (eq to 8 mg procaine penicillin and 10 mg dihydrostreptomycin sulphate per kg b. wt.).\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\n- Meat: Cattle: 23 days. & Sheep: 31 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not for use in animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\t\r\r\nContraindicated: in known cases of hypersensitivity to penicillins.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage:\r\r\nStore in a dark place at a temperature below 30ºC.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\n20, 50 & 100 ml sterile glass bottles.",

However, absorption of Penicillin G from a procaine penicillin preparation is prolonged, with peak blood levels being attained at approximately 2-4 hours and declining below therapeutic levels at 24 hours in pigs and 48 hours in cattle and sheep.\r\r\n- Dihydrostreptomycin is also absorbed rapidly. Peak plasma concentration occurs within 1 hour. The blood levels will decline a lot faster (below therapeutic levels at 12 hours) than the penicillin G due to a slower absorption of the penicillin from the procaine preparation.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECOMMENDED USE\r\r\nFor the treatment of infections caused by bacteria sensitive to penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle and Sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Shake well before use. \r\r\n- The recommended dose is 4 ml per 100 kg body weight i.e. 8,000 IU procaine penicillin and 10 mg dihydrostreptomycin per kg.\r\r\n- For intramuscular administration only.\r\r\n- To ensure a correct dosage bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid under-dosing.\r\r\n- Clean the area of injection and swab with spirit.\r\r\n- The maximum dose volume recommended at any one site for Cattle is 20 ml.\r\r\n- Avoid the introduction or contamination during use. If any growth or discoloration occurs, discard the product. \r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS & WARNINGS\r\r\n- Not to be administered to animals known to be sensitive to penicillins. Occasional allergies to penicillins have been observed but these are rare.\r\r\n- Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions to penicillin can vary from localised swelling to anaphylaxis and death.\r\r\n- Penicillin and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact.\r\r\n- Hypersensitivity to penicillin may lead to cross sensitivity to cephalosporins and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances can occasionally be serious.\r\r\n1. Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.\r\r\n2. Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions. If you develop symptoms following exposure, such as a skin rash you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning Swelling of the face, lips and eyes or difficulty with breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n- Not to be used when it is known that penicillinase-producing staphylococcus organisms are present.\r\r\n- Not To use in lactating ewes producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Tetracycline  are bacteriostatic antibiotics that presumably may interfere with a bactericidal agent such as penicillin. If penicillin is used with a tetracycline, it would be prudent to observe the following points when possible: Be sure that adequate amount of each are given; antagonism is most likely to occur when barely sufficient amounts of each agent are given. Begin administration of the penicillin at least a few hours before the administration of tetracycline.\r\r\n- Don't exceed the stated dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Occasional allergies to penicillins have been observed but these are very rare. Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions to penicillins can vary from localised swelling to anaphylaxis and death.\r\r\n- Occasionally in sucking and fattening pigs administration of products containing procaine penicillin may cause a transient pyrexia, vomiting, shivering, listlessness and incoordination.\r\r\n- In pregnant sows and gilts a vulval discharge which could be associated with abortion has been reported.\r\r\n- Procaine penicillin G can, under certain circumstances, be toxic and even lethal to pigs and this is thought to be due to a sudden release of toxic amounts of free procaine. The symptoms include shivering, lassitude, inappetence, vomiting, cyanosis of the extremities and pronounced pyrexia (40°C and over). A vulval discharge may appear and some animals may abort. Alarming side-effects are most likely to occur when pigs with erysipelas are injected with an older and/or, heat-affected procaine penicillin formulation. Treatment with 5 mg dexamethasone will result in rapid recovery.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\n- Procaine penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin are safe for use in pregnant animals.\r\r\n- Not for use in lactating ewes producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS FOR ANIMALS\r\r\nUse of this product should be based on susceptibility testing of the bacteria isolated from the animal. If this is not possible, therapy should be based on local (regional,farm level) epidemiological information about susceptibility of the target bacteria. Whenever possible the product should only be used on the basis of susceptibility testing.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD\r\r\n- Cattle:\r\r\n-- edible tissues from slaughtered animal: 21 days.\r\r\n-- Milk: 72 hours.\r\r\n- Sheep:\r\r\n-- edible tissues from slaughtered animal: 21 days\r\r\n-- Milk: Not to be used in lactating ewes producing milk for human consumption\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years\r\r\n- After first opening: 4 weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n- Do not store above 15°C, Do not freeze.\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach and sight of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nShake well before use.

        "description": "Penbex is a complex antibacterial drug. It is a sterile white suspension for injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\r\nEach ml contains:\r\r\n- Penicillin procaine G – 200000 ME,\r\r\n- Dihydrostreptomycin sulfate – 250 mg,\r\r\n- Betamethasone – 0.5 mg,\r\r\n- Chlorpheniramine maleate – 8 mg,\r\r\n- Procaine hydrochloride and filler – 15 mg.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n» The antibiotics penicillin procaine and dihydrostreptomycin sulfate, which are part of the drug, exhibit synergistic action, thereby increasing the effect of antibiotics and expanding the spectrum of the antimicrobial activity of the drug.\r\r\n» Penicillin procaine G belongs to the group of natural penicillins, it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, most anaerobic bacteria and spirochetes, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Listeria spp., Pastorysida spp., Clostridium spp., , Leptospira strains Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, etc.\r\r\n» The mechanism of action of penicillin procaine G is to block the synthesis of peptidoglycan (the main component of the bacterial cell wall), leading to the death of the microorganism.\r\r\n» Dihydrostreptomycin sulfate is an antibiotic from the aminoglycoside group that has a pronounced bactericidal effect on gram-negative microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Pasteurella spp., Klebsiella spp. The antibacterial effect of dihydrostreptomycin sulfate is based on the disruption of protein synthesis by the ribosomes of the microbial cell. After a single intramuscular injection of the drug penicillin, procaine and dihydrostreptomycin sulfate are absorbed into the blood and penetrate into the affected tissues of the animal, reaching maximum blood concentrations within an hour and remain at therapeutic concentrations for up to 24 hours. Antibiotics are excreted from the body mainly with urine and bile, in lactating animals, partially with milk.\r\r\n» Betamethasone inhibits the activity of phospholipase, and also helps to suppress inflammation at the site of the lesion. Chlorpheniramine maleate acts as an antihistamine, and also increases the protective functions of the body in diseases of the respiratory tract. According to the degree of impact on the body of warm-blooded animals, Penbex belongs to moderately hazardous substances.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nAssign to large and small ruminants, horses, pigs, dogs and cats for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory system, genitourinary system, musculoskeletal system, colibacillosis, salmonellosis, pasteurellosis, gastroenterocolitis, mastitis, operating rooms, wounds, postpartum and other primary and secondary infections of bacterial etiology, the causative agents of which are sensitive to penicillin and streptomycin.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSES AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nPenbex is administered to animals deeply intramuscularly once a day in the following doses:\r\r\n» adult cattle and horses at the rate of 1 ml per 20 kg of animal weight, in case of a severe course of the disease, as well as calves and foals weighing up to 60 kg at the rate of 1 ml of the drug per 10 kg of animal weight.\r\r\n» For small cattle, pigs, dogs and cats, Penbex is used at the rate of 1 ml of the drug per 10 kg of animal weight.\r\r\n\r\r\n• The course of treatment is 3 – 5 days.\r\r\n• The maximum volume of the drug for administration in one place should not exceed 20 ml for cattle and horses, 10 ml for pigs, 5 ml for calves and sheep, and 2.5 ml for piglets.\r\r\n• Before use, the contents of the vial are thoroughly shaken until a homogeneous suspension is obtained.\r\r\n• If no noticeable clinical improvement occurs within 2 to 3 days, it is recommended to retest for the sensitivity of microorganisms to penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\nIn some animals, at the injection site, a local reaction may appear in the form of itching, erythema, edema, which disappear spontaneously after the drug is discontinued.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nHypersensitivity to penicillin antibiotics and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Renal and cardiovascular failure. Simultaneous or sequential use of Penbex with other ototoxic and nephrotoxic drugs (neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin) is not allowed due to the possible increase in oto- and nephrotoxic effects. The drug is not recommended to be administered to females in the last third of pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\r\r\nSlaughter of animals for meat, which used Penbex, is allowed 30 days after the last injection of the drug. In the event of the forced slaughter of animals before the established date, the meat is used to feed fur-bearing animals or for the production of meat and bone meal. Milk must not be used for food purposes during the treatment period and within 3 days after the drug is discontinued. Such milk can be used for feeding animals after heat treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nRELEASE FORM\r\r\nBottles of 10, 50, 100 and 250 ml.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\n- Store in a dry, dark place and out of reach of children at temperatures from 5 to 25 ºС.\r\r\n- During storage, sediment formation is allowed.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\nThree years",

        "description": "Each mL of this ready-to-use sterile suspension contains ceftiofur crystalline free acid eq to 200 mg ceftiofur, in a caprylic/capric triglyceride and cottonseed oil based suspension.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacology:\r\r\nCeftiofur is a beta-lactam antibiotic from the cephalosporin class. Beta lactams exert their inhibitory effect by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. This interference is primarily due to its covalent binding to the penicillin-binding proteins, which are essential for synthesis of the bacterial wall. Ceftiofur administered as either ceftiofur sodium (NAXCEL ® Sterile Powder) or ceftiofur crystalline free acid (EXCEDE Sterile Suspension) is rapidly metabolized to desfuroylceftiofur, the primary metabolite with antimicrobial activity. Two intramuscular injections of EXCEDE Sterile Suspension at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg body weight in the horse provide concentrations of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur related metabolites in plasma above the therapeutic target of 0.2 μg/mL for the entire 96 hour (4 day) dosing interval and for 6 days after the second injection (or a total of 10 days from the beginning of treatment)\r\n\r\nIndications:\r\n•  EXCEDE is indicated for treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD, shipping fever, pneumonia) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni in beef, non-lactating dairy, and lactating dairy cattle.\r\r\n•  EXCEDE is also indicated for the control of respiratory disease in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle which are at high risk of developing BRD associated with M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni.\r\r\n•  EXCEDE is also indicated for the treatment of bovine foot rot (interdigital necrobacillosis) associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum and Porphyromonas levii in beef, non-lactating dairy, and lactating dairy cattle.\r\r\n•  EXCEDE is also indicated for treatment of acute metritis (0-10 days post-partum) associated with bacterial organisms susceptible to ceftiofur in lactating dairy cattle.\r\n\r\nDosage:\r\r\n•  Shake well before using.\r\n•  Cattle: 3 ml / 100 kg in the base of ear by S/C.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period:\r\r\n• Following label use as either a single-dose or 2-dose regimen, a 13-day pre-slaughter withdrawal period is required after the last treatment.\r\r\n• Following label use as either a single-dose or 2-dose regimen, no milk discard period is required for this product.\r\r\n• Use of dosages in excess of 3.0 mg/lb (6.6 mg /kg) or administration by unapproved routes (subcutaneous injection in the neck or intramuscular injection) may cause violative residues.\r\r\n• A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves.\r\r\n• Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage: \r\r\n•  Store at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).\r\r\n•  Contents should be used within 12 weeks after the first dose is removed.\r\r\n\r\r\nPack:\r\r\n100-mL vial, 250-mL vial",

        "description": "Anthelmintic (Benzimidazole)\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\r\n- Fenbendazole 100 mg/ml\r\r\n\r\r\n- Fenbendazole is an anthelmintic belonging to the benzimidazole group which acts by blocking fumerate reductase which\r\r\nresults in the inhibition of the formation of adenosine triphosphate(involved in mitochondrial energy).\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Fenbendazole, like many benzimidazoles, blocks fumarate reductase which results in the inhibition of the formation of adenosine triphosphate (involved in mitochondrial energy). There is also evidence that it inhibits glucose uptake and therefore increases glycogen utilization and depletes the worm’s glycogen reserves. The overall effect of this action is to effectively starve the parasite to death. Furthermore this action results in the detachment of the parasites but in the case of intestinal helminths this detachment does not result in loss of contact with the drug whereas in the case of the liver fluke such detachment would reduce such contact. This probably explains its limited effect on the liver fluke and the good effect on intestinal helminths.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\nFenbendazole is poorly soluble in water and consequentlyis poorly absorbed; something which is reflected in the relatively low plasma levels. The scheme for the known metabolic pathways is given by Short, Flory, Hsieh and Barker (1988) together with the relative rates of breakdown in various species.

It has been pointed out by Campbell, Ostlind and Yakis (1970) that the formulation has a significant effect on the potency of the product in terms of efficacy. Lee (1973), in a comparison of a number of salicylanilides, has demonstrated that activity increased with increasing half-life. Those with a half-life of five to six days, such as rafoxanide, were very active fasciolacides.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n- For the treatment of fascioliasis in cattle and sheep and also nasal worm, Oestrus ovis, in sheep.\r\r\n- Ranide Oral Drench is active against Fasciola Hepatica (mature and immature fluke over 8 weeks of age)\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration: \r\r\n- For oral use in cattle and sheep only.\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n- To ensure administration of a correct dose, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible; accuracy of the dosing device should be checked. If animals are to be treated collectively rather than individually, they should be grouped according to their bodyweight and dosed accordingly,in order to avoid under- or overdosing.\r\r\n- To be given orally at a dose rate of 7.5 mg Rafoxanide / kgbodyweight for sheep and 11.25 mg Rafoxanide / kg for cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nCattle \r\r\n 50 kg - 18.75 ml\r\r\n 100 kg - 37.5 ml\r\r\n 150 kg - 56.25 ml\r\r\n 200 kg - 75.0 ml\r\r\n 250 kg - 93.75 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep\r\r\n 10 kg - 2.5 ml\r\r\n 15 kg - 3.5 ml\r\r\n 20 kg - 5.0 ml\r\r\n 25 kg - 6.5 ml\r\r\n 30 kg - 7.5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nRanide Oral Drench tolerance studies have shown that the product is well tolerated in cattle and sheep at three times the recommended dosage. No significant changes were observed in haematological measurements or blood biochemical parameters over a 28-day period post treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Period\r\r\n- Animals should not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment or for 60 days thereafter.\r\r\n- Not authorised for use in animals producing milk for human consumption including during the dry period. Do not use during the last trimester of pregnancy in heifers which are intended to produce milk for human consumption. Do not use within 1 year prior to the first lambing in ewes intended to produce milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings\r\r\n- Irreversible liver damage may have occurred before treatment is given. This can lead to death in severe cases irrespective of treatment.\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n-- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n-- Underdosing which may be due to underestimation of bodyweight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device.\r\r\n- Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the tests strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacologicalclass and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf-life\r\r\nAs packaged for sale: 3 years\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\nStore below 25oC.\r\r\nDo not freeze.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\n 1 L, 2.5 L, 5 L",

        "description": "COMPOSITION\r\r\nEach ml contains:\r\r\n- Amoxicillin 150 mg (eq to amoxicillin trihydrate 172 mg)\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n- Amoxicillin is mainly distributed to the extra-cellular compartment. Its distribution into tissues is facilitated by its low degree of plasma protein binding. Concentrations in pulmonary, pleural and bronchial tissues are similar to plasma concentrations. Amoxicillin diffuses into pleural and synovial fluid and into lymphatic tissue.\r\r\n- A small proportion of amoxicillin (around 20%) is biotransformed in the liver by hydrolysis of the ß-lactam ring leading to inactive penicilloic acid.\r\r\n- Amoxicillin is mainly excreted in active form via the kidneys, and secondarily by the biliary route and through milk.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the β-lactam family belonging to the aminopenicillin group. This substance has time-dependent bactericidal activity and acts against Gram-positive and some Gram-negative microorganisms.\r\r\n- The mechanism of antibacterial action of amoxicillin is the inhibition of the biochemical processes of bacterial cell wall synthesis by an irreversible and selective inhibition of various enzymes involved in these processes, mainly transpeptidases, endopeptidases and carboxypeptidases. Inadequate synthesis of the bacterial wall in susceptible species produces an osmotic imbalance that particularly affects the growth of bacteria (when the processes of bacterial wall synthesis are particularly important), eventually leading to lysis of the bacterial cell.\r\r\n- Species considered to be susceptible to amoxicillin include Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus spp, and Gram-negative bacteria: Pasteurellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae including strains of E. coli.\r\r\n- Bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin are Penicillinase-producing staphylococci, certain Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\r\r\n- There are three main mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams: beta-lactamase production, altered expression and/or modification of penicillin binding proteins (PBP), and decreased penetration of the outer membrane. One of the most\r\r\nimportant is the inactivation of penicillin by beta-lactamase enzymes produced by certain bacteria. These enzymes are capable of cleaving the beta-lactam ring of penicillins, making them inactive. The beta-lactamase could be encoded in chromosomal or plasmidic genes.\r\r\n- Acquired resistances are frequent for Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli which produce different types of β-lactamases that\r\r\nremain in the periplasmic space. Cross-resistance is observed between amoxicillin and other penicillins, particularly with aminopenicillins.\r\r\n- The use of extended spectrum beta-lactam drugs (e.g. aminopenicillins) might lead to the selection of multi-resistant bacterial phenotypes (e.g. those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)).\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- Cattle, sheep and pigs - By intramuscular injection only.\r\r\n- Dogs and cats - subcutaneous or intramuscular use.\r\r\n- Shake the vial vigorously to achieve full resuspension before use.\r\r\n- This product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative, swab the septum before removing each dose.\r\r\n- The recommended dosage rate is 15 mg per kg bodyweight, eq to 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight to be repeated once after 48 hours.\r\r\n- If dose volume exceeds 15 ml in cattle and 4 ml in sheep and pigs, it should be divided and injected into two or more sites.\r\r\n- The stopper should not be punctured more than 40 times\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 39 days\r\r\n- Milk: 108 hours (4.5 days)\r\r\n\r\r\nPigs:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 42 days\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 29 days\r\r\n- Milk: Not authorised for use in sheep producing milk for human consumption\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf-life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years\r\r\n- After first opening the: 28 days\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\nDo not store above 25°C, Protect from light.",

Inside the cell it binds irreversibly to receptors on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome where it interferes with the binding of the aminoacyl-transfer RNA to the acceptor site on the messenger RNA ribosome complex. This effectively prevents the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, inhibiting protein synthesis. The product is specifically formulated to provide a prolonged action resulting in sustained antibacterial activity.\r\r\n- Oxytetracycline had been shown to be effective in vitro against the following bacterial species: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Escherichia coli, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella dublin, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus uberis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES\r\r\nBlood levels persist for at least 4 days after administration by the intramuscular route. Maximum blood levels are achieved between 4 and 8 hours following intramuscular administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nMAJOR INCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years\r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.

A wide range of organisms are known to be sensitive in vitro to oxytetracycline, including Pasteurella spp, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and certain mycoplasmas.\r\r\n- After oxytetracycline diffuses through the outer bacterial cell membrane, an active carrier mediated process transports the drugs through the inner cytoplasmic membrane. Inside the cell, oxytetracycline binds irreversibly to receptors on the 30S sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome where it interferes with the binding of the aminoacyl- transfer RNA to the acceptor site on the messenger RNA ribosome complex. This effectively prevents the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, inhibiting protein synthesis.\r\r\n- Flunixin meglumine is a relatively potent non- narcotic, non-steroidal analgesic with anti- inflammatory, anti-endotoxic and anti-pyretic properties.\r\r\n- Flunixin meglumine acts as a reversible inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, an important enzyme in the arachidonic acid cascade pathway which is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides. Consequently, synthesis of eicosanoids, important mediators of the inflammatory process involved in central pyresis, pain perception and tissue inflammation, is inhibited. Through its effects on the arachidonic acid cascade, flunixin also inhibits the production of thromboxane, a potent platelet pro-aggregator and vasoconstrictor which is released during blood clotting. Flunixin exerts its antipyretic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the hypothalamus. By inhibiting the arachidonic acid cascade pathway, flunixin also produces an anti-endotoxic effect by suppressing eicosanoid formation and therefore preventing their involvement in endotoxin associated disease states.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nOxyflu LA is indicated for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease associated with Mannheimia haemolytica (Pasturella multocida) where an anti- inflammatory and anti-pyretic effect is required.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n- By deep intramuscular administration to cattle.\r\r\n- 1 ml Oxyflu L.A / 10 kg bodyweight on a single occasion.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions:\r\r\n- Maximum volume per injection site: 15ml.

The presence of the disease in the herd should be established before metaphylactic treatment.\r\r\n- Treatment of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) associated with Moraxella bovis sensitive to tulathromycin.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs\r\r\n- Treatment of swine respiratory disease associated with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis and Bordetella bronchiseptica sensitive to tulathromycin.\r\r\n- The presence of the disease in the herd should be established before metaphylactic treatment. Draxxin should if only be used if pigs are expected to develop the disease within 2--3 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep\r\r\nTreatment of the early stages of infectious pododermatitis (foot rot) associated with virulent Dichelobacter nodosus requiring systemic treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in case of hypersensitivity of the target animals to macrolide antibiotics.\r\r\n- Do not use simultaneously with other macrolides or lincosamides.\r\r\n- Do not use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Do not use in pregnant animals, which intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Subcutaneous administration of Draxxin to cattle causes very commonly transient pain reactions and local swellings at the injection site that can persist for up to 30 days. No such reactions have been observed in pigs and sheep after intramuscular administration.\r\r\n- Pathomorphological injection site reactions (including reversible changes of congestion, oedema, fibrosis and haemorrhage) are very common for approximately 30 days after injection in cattle and pigs.\r\r\n- In sheep, transient signs of discomfort (head shaking, rubbing injection site, backing away) are very common after intramuscular injection. These signs resolve within a few minutes.\r\r\n- The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n-- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals displaying adverse reaction(s) during the course of one treatment)\r\r\n-- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals)\r\r\n-- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals)\r\r\n-- rare (more e than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals)\r\r\n-- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals, including isolated reports).\r\r\n- If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this package leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle, pigs and sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Cattle (treatment and metaphylaxis)\r\r\n- 2.5 mg tulathromycin / kg bodyweight (equivalent to 1 ml / 40 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- A single subcutaneous injection. For treatment of cattle over 300 kg bodyweight, divide the dose so that no more than 7.5 ml are injected at one site.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs\r\r\n- 2.5 mg tulathromycin / kg bodyweight (equivalernt to 1 ml / 40 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- A single intramuscular injection in the neck. For treatment of pigs over 80 Kg bodyweight, divide the dose so that no more than 2 ml are injected at one site.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep\r\r\n- 2.5 mg tulathromycin / kg bodyweight (equivalent to 1 ml / 40 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- A single intramuscular injection in the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- It is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of the disease and to evaluate the response to treatment within 48 hours after injection. If clinical signs of respiratory disease persist or increase, or if relapse occurs, treatment should be changed, using another antibiotic, and continued until clinical signs have resolved.\r\r\n- To ensure correct dosage bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing. For multiple vial entry, an aspirating needle or multi-dose syringe is recommended to avoid excessive broaching of the stopper.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Cattle (meat and offal): 22 days.\r\r\n- Pigs (meat and offal): 13 days.\r\r\n- Sheep (meat and offal): 16 days.\r\r\n- Not authorised for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Do not use in pregnant animals, which are intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.\r\r\n- This veterinary medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions.\r\r\n- Do not use this veterinary medicinal product after the expiry date which is stated on the label after EXP.\r\r\n- Shelf life after first opening the container: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n» For sheep:\r\r\n- The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment of foot rot might be reduced by others factors, such as wet environmental conditions, as well as inappropriate farm management. Treatment of foot rot should therefore be undertaken along with other flock management tools, for example providing dry environment.\r\r\n- Antibiotic treatment of benign foot rot is not considered appropriate. Draxxin showed limited efficacy in sheep with severe clinical signs or chronic foot rot, and should therefore only be given at an early stage of foot rot.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For use in animals:\r\r\n- Use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing of the bacteria isolated from the animal.\r\r\n- Official, national and regional antimicrobial policies should be taken into account when the product is used.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the administrator\r\r\n- Tulathromycin is irritating to eyes. In case of accidental eye exposure, flush the eyes immediately with clean water.\r\r\n- Tulathromycin may cause sensitisation by skin contact. In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash the skin immediately with soap and water.\r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n- In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pregnancy and lactation:\r\r\n- Laboratory studies in rats and rabbits have not produced any evidence of teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effects.\r\r\n- The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation. Use only according to the benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Forms of interaction:\r\r\nDo not administer simultaneously with antimicrobials with a similar mode of action such as other macrolides or lincosamides.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Overdose\r\r\n- In cattle at dosages of three, five or ten times the recommended dose, transient signs attributed to injection site discomfort were observed and included restlessness, head-shaking, pawing the ground, and brief decrease in feed intake. Mild myocardial degeneration has been observed in cattle receiving 5 to 6 times the recommended dose.\r\r\n- In young pigs weighing approximately 10 kg given three or five times the therapeutic dose transient signs attributed to injection site discomfort were observed and included excessive vocalisation and restlessness. Lameness was also observed when the hind leg was used as the injection site.\r\r\n- In lambs (approx. 6 weeks old), at dosages of three or five times the recommended dose, transient signs attributed to injection site discomfort were observed and included walking backwards, head shaking, rubbing the injection site, lying down and getting up, bleating.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Incompatibilities:\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECNUTIONS\r\r\n- Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.\r\r\n- These measures should help to protect the environment.\r\r\n\r\r\nOTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- Tulathromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antimicrobial agent, which originates from a fermentation product. It differs from many other macrolides in that it has a long duration of action that is, in part, due to its three anmine groups; therefore it has been given the chemical subclass designation of triamilide.\r\r\n- Macrolides are bacteriostatic acting antibiotics and inhibit essential protein biosynthesis by virtue of their selective binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA. They act by stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome during the translocation process.\r\r\n- Tulathromycin possesses in vitro activity against Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with bovine and swine respiratory disease, respectively. Increased minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values have been found in some isolates of Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In vitro activity against Dichelobacter nodosus (vir), the bacterial pathogen most commonly associated with infectious pododermatitis (foot rot) in sheep has been demonstrated.\r\r\n- Tulathromycin also possesses in vitro activityagainst Moraxella bovis, the bacterial pathogen most commonly associated with infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (BK).\r\r\n- Resistance to macrolides can develop by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or some ribosomal proteins; by enzymatic modification (methylation) of the 23S rRNA target site, generally giving rise to cross-resistance with lincosamides and group B streptogramins (MLSb resistance); by enzymatic inactivation; or by macrolide efflux. MLSgb resistance may be constitutive or inducible. Resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferable if associated with transposons or plasmids.\r\r\n- In addition to its antimicrobial properties, tulathromycin demonstrates immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory actions in experimental studies. In both bovine and porcine polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs; neutrophils), tulathromycin promotes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. It lowers the production of the pro-inflammatory mediators leukotriene B4 and CXCL-8 and induces the production of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid lipoxin A4.\r\r\n- In cattle, the pharmacokinetic profñle of tulathromycin when administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg bodyweight, was characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination. The maximum concentration (Cmax) in plasma was approximately 0.5 mcg/ml; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing (Tmax). Tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma. There is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages.\r\r\n- However, the in vivo concentration of tulathromycin at the infection site of the lung is not known. Peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of 90 hours in plasma. Plasma protein binding was low, approximately 40%. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) determined after intravenous administration was 11 /kg. The bioavailability of tulathromycin after subcutaneous administration in cattle was approximately 90%.\r\r\n- In pigs, the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin when administered as single intramuscular dose of 2.5 mg/kg bodyweight, was also characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination. The maximum concentration (Cmax) in plasma was approximately 0.6 ug/ml; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing (Tmax). Tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma. There is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages.\r\r\n- However, the in vivo concentration of tulathromycin at the infection site of the lung is not known. Peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life (t/2) of approximately 91 hours in plasma. Plasma protein binding was low, approximately 40%. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) determined after intravenous administration was 13.2 litre / kg. The bioavailability of tulathromycin after intramuscular administration in pigs was approximately 88%.\r\r\n- In sheep, the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin, when administered as a single intramuscular dose of 2.5 mg/kg bodyweight, achieved a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.19 mcg/ml approximately 15 minutes (Tmax) post dosing and had an elimination half-life (t1/2) of 69.7 hours. Plasma protein binding was approximately 60-759%. Following intravenous dosing the volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) was 31.7 litre / kg. The bioavailability of tulathromycin after intramuscular administration in sheep was 100%.\r\r\n\r\r\nPack sizes:\r\r\n- 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 ml\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n- 500 ml vials must not be used for pigs and sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor any information about this veterinary medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder.\r\r\n\r\r\nDATE ON WHICH THE PACKAGE LEAFLET WAS LAST APPROVED\r\r\n23/03/2017.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Detailed information on this product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency\r\r\n(http://www.ema.europa.eu).\r\r\n\r\r\nMarketing authorisation holder:\r\r\nZoetis Belgium SA\r\r\nRue Laid Burniat 1\r\r\n1348 Louvain-la-Neuve\r\r\nBELGIUM\r\r\n\r\r\nManufacturers responsible for batch\r\r\nrelease:\r\r\nFAREVA AMBOISE\r\r\nZone Industrielle,\r\r\n29 route des Industries\r\r\n37530 Pocé-sur-Cisse\r\r\nFRANCE\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd\r\r\n\r\r\nZoetis Manufacturing & Research Spain, S.L.\r\r\nCtra.

Moreover, spiramycin inhibits the adhesion of the bacteria to the epithelial cells (particularly for gram positive like Stapnyiococcuss and Streptococcus) and stimulates the phagocytosis capacity of the polynuclear neutrophils. Spiramyain has post-antibiotic effects. Spiramycin has some antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas, as well as certain Gram-negative germs, particularly Legionella and Actinobacillus.\r\r\n» The spectrum of activity of spiramycin includes Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria  intracellularis, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium diphteriae, Mycoplasma sp., Clostridium sp., Bacteroides sp., Haemophilus sp., Treponema pallidum, Treponema microdentium, Leptospira ictero-hemorragiae, Toxoplasma, Miyagawanella, Brucella, Pasteurella, Rickettsia sp. and Amoeba sp..\r\r\n» Spiramycin is widely distributed into tissues and secretions, in particular genital tissues, respiratory system and milk. It presents good intracellular penetration.\r\r\n» The spiramycin half life is very long: 20.9 hours after intramuscular injection.\r\r\n» It is extensively metabolised through the biliary system, which contributes to its enteric effect.\r\r\n» Spiramycin toxicity is very low.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS FOR USE\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n- Treatment of acute clinical and subclinical mastitis in lactating cows caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis strains sensitive to spiramycin.\r\r\n- Treatment of respiratory infections caused by Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» For intramuscular use. Bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.\r\r\n- Mastitis: 30000 IU of spiramycin per kg bodyweight (i.e. 5 ml per 100 kg) at 24h of interval.\r\r\n- Respiratory infections: 100000 IU of spiramycin per kg bodyweight (i.e. 5 ml per 30 kg) twice at 48h of interval. Do not administer more than 15 ml per injection site.\r\r\n» If this means that the dose must be divided into two injections, then injections should be administered on opposite sides of the neck. If more than two injections are needed, a distance of at least 15 cm should be maintained between infections given on the same side of the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not treat animals hypersensitive to macrolides.\r\r\n- Do not use in new born pets animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\n- Mastitis: Meat and offal: 75 days.

Danofloxacin concentrations in the lung homogenates markedly exceed those observed in plasma, further suggesting extensive distribution to the indicated site of infection. Danofloxacin is rapidly eliminated from the body (apparent terminal elimination T½ ranging from 3–6 hours), and negligible accumulation was observed when animals were dosed twice, 48 hours apart.\r\r\n- Danofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and is highly bioavailable when administered as a subcutaneous injection in the neck. Linear pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated when danofloxacin is administered to cattle by subcutaneous injection at doses between 1.25 to 10 mg/kg. No statistically significant gender difference was observed in peak or total systemic exposure following a single subcutaneous administration of danofloxacin to heifers and steers at a dose of 6 mg/kg body weight.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n- The effects of danofloxacin on bovine reproductive performance, pregnancy, and lactation have not been determined.\r\r\n- Subcutaneous injection can cause a transient local tissue reaction that may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter.\r\r\n- Quinolone-class drugs should be used with caution in animals with known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In such animals, quinolones have, in rare instances, been associated with CNS stimulation, which may lead to convulsive seizures.\r\r\n- Quinolone-class drugs have been shown to produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature, rapidly growing animals of various species. Refer to Animal Safety for information specific to danofloxacin.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS:\r\r\n- A hypersensitivity reaction was noted in 2 healthy calves treated with ADVOCIN in a laboratory study. In one location of a multi-site field trial, one out of the 41 calves treated with 6 mg/kg q 48 hours showed lameness on Day 6 only. In this same field trial location one of 38 calves treated with 8 mg/kg once became lame 4 days after treatment and remained lame on the last day of the study (Day 10). Another calf in the same treatment group developed lameness on the last day of the study.\r\r\n\r\r\nRESIDUE WARNINGS:\r\r\n- Animals intended for human consumption must not be slaughtered within 4 days from the last treatment.\r\r\n- A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in preruminating calves.\r\r\n- Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE:\r\r\n- 100 mL vial:Use this product within 28 days of the first puncture and puncture a maximum of 7 times.\r\r\n- 250 mL vial:Use this product within 28 days of the first puncture and puncture a maximum of 17 times.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE INFORMATION:\r\r\n- Store at or below 30°C (86°F).

Do not use in animals suffering from impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and haemorrhagic disorders, or when there is evidence of ulcerogenic gastrointestinal lesions. Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration route\r\r\n- A single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 40 mg florfenicol/kg bodyweight and 0.5 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i.e. 1 ml/10 kg bodyweight).\r\r\n- The single dose volume should not exceed 15 ml per injection site. The injection should only be given in the neck area.\r\r\n- To ensure a correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing. For the 250 ml vials, the rubber stopper may safely be punctured up to 20 times. Otherwise, the use of a multiple-dose syringe is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nMajor incompatibilities\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Florfenicol is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from domestic animals. Florfenicol acts by inhibiting protein synthesis at the ribosomal level and its action is bacteriostatic and time-dependent. Laboratory tests have shown that florfenicol is active against the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens involved in bovine respiratory disease which include Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n- Florfenicol is considered to be a bacteriostatic agent, but in vitro studies demonstrate its bactericidal activity against Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n- For Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni the following florfenicol breakpoints have been determined by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards institute) for bovine respiratory pathogens: susceptible ≤ 2 µg/ml, intermediate: 4 µg/ml, resistant: ≥ 8 µg/ml. Resistance to florfenicol is mainly mediated by an efflux system due to a specific (Flo-R) or multidrug transporter (AcrAB-TolC). The genes corresponding to these mechanisms are coded on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposon or genes cassettes. Resistance to florfenicol in the target pathogens has only been reported on rare occasions, and was associated with efflux pump and the presence of the floR gene.\r\r\n- Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative, analgesic and antipyretic effects. It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue. To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation. Meloxicam also has anti-endotoxic properties, because it has been shown to inhibit production of thromboxane B2 induced by E. coli endotoxin after administration in calves, lactating cows and pigs. The bioavailability of meloxicam in this combination product is lower compared to the use of meloxicam when administered on its own. The impact of this difference on anti-inflammatory effects has not been investigated in field trials. However, a clear antipyretic effect has been demonstrated in the first 48 hours after administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n- After subcutaneous administration of the product at recommended dose of 1 ml/10 kg bodyweight maximum mean plasma concentration (Cmax) of 4.6 mg/l and 2.0 mg/l occurred 10 hours (h) and 7 h after dosing for florfenicol and meloxicam, respectively. Efficacious plasma levels of florfenicol are maintained above the MIC90 of 1 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml and 0.2 µg/ml for 72 h, 120 h and 160 h, respectively.\r\r\n- Florfenicol is largely distributed in the whole body and has a low plasma protein binding (approximately 20%). Meloxicam is extensively bound to plasma proteins (97%) and is distributed in all well-perfused organs.\r\r\n- Florfenicol is mainly excreted via the urine and to a small extent via the faeces with a half-life of about 60 h.\r\r\n- Meloxicam excretion is equally divided between urine and faeces, with a half-life of about 23 h.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nIn pre-ruminant calves, repeated administration of the recommended dose once per week for three weeks was well tolerated, as well as a single administration of 3 times (3x) the recommended dose. Repeated weekly administration of overdoses (3x and 5x the recommended dose) in calves was associated with decreased milk consumption, decreased weight gain, loose faeces or diarrhoea. Repeated weekly administration of a 3x dose was fatal in 1 out of 8 calves after the third administration. Repeated weekly administration of a 5x dose was fatal in 7 out of 8 calves after the third administration. The extent of these adverse effects was dose-dependent. Macroscopic intestinal lesions were observed post-mortem (presence of fibrin, abomasal ulcers, haemorrhagic dots and thickening of the abomasal wall).\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings for target species\r\r\nNone.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for animals\r\r\n- Whenever possible, the veterinary medicinal product should only be used based on susceptibility testing. Official, national and regional antimicrobial policies should be taken into account when the veterinary medicinal product is used.\r\r\n- Avoid use in severely dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals, as there may be a potential risk of renal toxicity. In the absence of safety data it is not recommended to use the product in calves less than 4 weeks old.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial for the person\r\r\nThe product is slightly irritant to the eye. Rinse any splashes from eyes immediately with plenty of water. In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician. People with known hypersensitivity to florfenicol, meloxicam or to any of the excipients should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product. Dose dependent maternotoxic and foetotoxic effects have been observed after oral administration of meloxicam to pregnant rats. Therefore, the veterinary medicinal product should not be administered by pregnant women.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions\r\r\nInjection site reactions (mostly swelling, induration, heat and pain) were very commonly observed after subcutaneous administration of the product. These effects were transitory and usually resolved without any treatment within 5 to 15 days, but could persist up to 49 days. During injection of this product animals may exhibit signs of moderate pain, manifested as movement of the head or neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nUse during pregnancy, lactation or lay\r\r\n- The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established in breeding, pregnant and lactating animals. Use only according to the benefit-risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.\r\r\n- Fertility: Do not use in adult bulls intended for breeding (see Contraindications).\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions\r\r\nDo not administer concurrently with glucocorticoids, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with anticoagulant agents.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period(s)\r\r\nMeat and offal: 56 days.\r\r\nMilk: Not authorised for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption. Do not use in pregnant cows, which are intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacological particulars\r\r\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, amphenicols, combinations.

        "description": "Composition:\r\r\n- Florfenicol  300 mg / ml\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Florfenicol is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against most Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria isolated from domestic animals.\r\r\n- Florfenicol acts by inhibiting bacteria protein synthesis at the ribosomal level, thus is bacteriostatic. However, in vitro tests have shown that florfenicol has a bactericidal activity against the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory diseases:\r\r\n-- Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolated from cattle\r\r\n-- Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, and Pasteurella multocida isolated from pigs.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Acquired resistance to florfenicol is mediated by efflux pump resistance associated with a floR gene. Such resistance has not yet been identified in the target pathogens except for Pasteurella multocida. Cross resistance with chloramphenicol can occur. Resistance to florfenicol and other antimicrobials has been identified in the food-born pathogen Salmonella typhimurium and co-resistance with the third-generation cephalosporins has been observed in respiratory and digestive Escherichia coli.\r\r\n- For Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni the following breakpoints have been determined for florfenicol in bovine respiratory disease; susceptible: ≤2 µg/ml, intermediate: 4 µg/ml, resistant: ≥8 µg/ml.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n• In cattle: Intramuscular administration of the formulation at the recommended dose of 20 mg/kg maintains efficacious blood levels for 48 hours. Maximum mean serum concentration (Cmax) of 3.8 µg/ml occurred 5.7 hours (Tmax) after dosing. The mean serum concentration 24 hours after dosing was 1.95 µg/ml. The mean elimination half life was 15.3 hours\r\r\n\r\r\n• In pigs: After intramuscular administration of florfenicol, maximum serum concentration of 4.7 µg/ml is reached after 1.8 hours and the concentrations deplete with a terminal mean half-life of 14.8 hours. Serum concentrations drop below 1 µg/ml, the MIC90 for the target porcine pathogens, 12-24 hours following IM administration. Florfenicol concentrations achieved in lung tissue reflect plasma concentration, with a lung: plasma concentration ratio of approximately 1. After administration to pigs by the intramuscular route, florfenicol is rapidly excreted, primarily in urine. The florfenicol is extensively metabolised.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications for use\r\r\nDiseases caused by florfenicol susceptible bacteria. Cattle: Treatment of respiratory tract infections due to Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni. Pigs: Treatment of acute outbreaks of swine respiratory disease caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida susceptible to florfenicol.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage\r\r\n- Intramuscular use. The injection should be given in the neck.\r\r\n• Cattle: 20 mg florfenicol per kg bodyweight, i.e. 1 ml of solution per 15 kg bodyweight, twice 48 hours apart. \r\r\n• Pigs: 15 mg florfenicol per kg bodyweight, i.e. 1 ml of solution per 20 kg bodyweight, twice 48 hours apart.\r\r\n- The dose volume given at any one injection site should not exceed 10 ml in cattle and 3 ml in pigs.\r\r\n- To ensure a correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.\r\r\n- It is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of disease and to evaluate the response to treatment within 48 hours after the second injection.\r\r\n- If clinical signs of respiratory disease persist 48 hours after the last injection, treatment should be changed using another formulation or another antibiotic and continued until clinical signs have resolved. \r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period(s)\r\r\n- Cattle: Meat and offal: 46 days / intramuscular use; 54 days / subcutaneous use.  Milk: Not permitted for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Pigs: Meat and offal: 18 days \r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\n- Shelf-life\r\r\n   As packaged for sale: 2 years.\r\r\n   After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n- This veterinary medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nColourless glass vial type II (20 – 50 – 100 – 250 - 500 ml).

        "description": "COMPOSITION\r\r\nEach ml contains: \r\r\nActive substance:\r\r\n- Florfenicol  300 mg\r\r\n- Flunixin (as flunixin meglumine)  16.5 mg\r\r\n\r\r\nExcipients\r\r\nPropylene glycol (E1520) 150 mg, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, Anhydrous citric acid and (Macrogol 300).\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL FORM\r\r\nSolution for injection. Clear, light yellow to straw coloured liquid.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATION(S)\r\r\nCurative treatment of respiratory infections caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni associated with pyrexia.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in adult bulls intended for breeding purposes.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals suffering from hepatic, cardiac or renal diseases.\r\r\n- Do not use in the case of known hypersensitivity to the product.\r\r\n- Do not use if there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or in cases where there is evidence of altered haemostasis.\r\r\n- Do not administer to animals less than 6 weeks of age.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nSubcutaneous administration of the product may result in injection site swellings that become palpable 2 - 3 days after injection. The duration of the injection site swellings ranged from 15 - 36 days post-injection. Grossly, this is associated with minimal to mild irritation of the subcutis. Extension into the underlying muscle was noted in only a few instances. By 56 days post-dosing, no gross lesions were observed that would require any trim-out at slaughter. If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» 40 mg / kg florfenicol and 2.2 mg / kg flunixin (2 ml / 15 kg body weight) to be e administered by a single subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n» To ensure correct dosage and avoid under dosing, body weight should be determined as accurately as possible. The dose volume given at any one injection site should not exceed 10 ml.\r\r\n » It is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of the disease and to evaluate the response to treatment 48 hours after injection. The anti-inflammatory component of Resflor, flunixin, may mask a poor bacteriological response to florfenicol in the first 24 hours after injection. If clinical signs of respiratory disease persist or increase, or if relapse occurs, treatment should be changed, using another antibiotic, and continued until clinical signs have resolved.\r\r\n» The injection should only be given in the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVIGE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nSwab septum before removing each dose. Use a dry sterile needle and syringe. Care should be taken to avoid accidental self-injection. The product should be used in conjunction with susceptibility testing and take into account official and local anti-microbial polices.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 46 days.\r\r\n- Milk: do not use in females producing milk for consumption, during lactation or drying off periods, nor in the 2 months preceding calving in animals to be used for producing milk for consumption in the future.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C. De not freeze.\r\r\n- Following withdrawal of first dose use the product within 28 days to be stored not above 25°C.\r\r\n- When the container is broached (opened) for the first time, using the in-use shelf-life which is specified on this package leaflet, the date on which any product remaining in the container should be discarded should be worked out. This discard date should be written in the space provided or the label.\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach and sight of children.\r\r\n- For animal treatment only.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n» The effect of florfenicol on bovine reproductive performance, pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed. Use only accordingly to the benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.\r\r\n» Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with flunixin for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.\r\r\n» Pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment. The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.\r\r\n» The product must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.\r\r\n» Gastrointestinal tract ulceration may be exacerbated by corticosteroids in animals given NSAIDs.\r\r\n» Avoid use in dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.\r\r\n» Overdose studies in the target species for 3 times the duration of treatment showed decreased food consumption in the groups given 3 and 5 times the recommended dose. Decreased body weights were observed in the 5 times overdose group (secondary to decreased food consumption). Decreased water consumption was observed in the 5 times overdose group. Tissue irritation increases with injection volume.\r\r\n» Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nOTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n» Florfenicol is a synthetic broad spectrum antibiotic effective against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from domestic animals. Florfenicol acts by iniibiting bacterial protein synthesis at the ribosomal level and is bacteriostatic. Laboratory tests have shown that florfenicol is active against the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens involved in bovine respiratory disease which include Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n» Florfenicol is considered to be a bacteriostatic agent, but in vitro studies of florfenicol demonstrate bactericidal activity against Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n» Florfenicol bactericidal activity was characterized as essentially time dependant against the three target pathogens with the possible exception of H. somni where a concentration dependency was observed.\r\r\n» During the florfenicol susceptibility monitoring program (2000-2003) a total of 487 M. haemolytica, 522 P. multocida and 25 H. somni isolates were collected. MIC values ranged between < 0.12 and 2 ug/ml for M. haemolytica (MIC90 = 1 µg/ml), between < 0.12 and 2 ug/ml for P. multocida (MIC90 = 0.5 µg/ml) and between 0.12 and 0.5 ug/ml for H. somni. Breakpoints have been established by the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute) for bovine respiratory pathogens as follows:\r\r\n\r\r\n • Pathogen:\r\r\nM. haemolytica, P. multocida and H. somni\r\r\n\r\r\n• Florfenicol disk conc (µg): 30\r\r\n\r\r\n• Diameter (mm):\r\r\nS ≥ 19, I 15-18 and R ≤ 14\r\r\n\r\r\n• MIC (µg/ml):\r\r\nS ≤ 2, I 4 and R ≥ 8\r\r\n\r\r\n» The only mechanisms of chloramphenicol resistance that are known to have significant clinical relevance are CAT-mediated inactivation and efflux-pump resistance. Of these, only some of the efflux mediated resistance would also confer resistance to florfenicol and thus have the potential to be affected by florfenicol use in animals. Resistance to florfenicol in the target pathogens has only been reported on rare occasions and was associated with efflux pump and the presence of the flo-R gene.\r\r\n» Flunixin meglumine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and antipyretic activity. Flunixin meglumine acts as a reversible non-selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase (both COX 1 and COX 2 forms), an important enzyme in the arachidonic acid cascade pathway which is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxdes. Consequently, synthesis of eicosanoids, important mediators of the inflammatory process involved in central pyresis, pain perception and tissue inflammation, is inhibited. Through its effects on the arachidonic acid cascade, flunixin also inhibits the production of thromboxane, a potent platelet pro- aggregator and vasoconstrictor which is released during blood clotting.\r\r\n» Flunixin exerts its antipyretic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the hypothalamus. Although flunixin has no direct effect on endotoxins after they have been produced, it reduces prostaglandin production and hence reduces the many effects of the prostaglandin cascade. Prostaglandins are part of the complex processes involved in the development of endotoxic shock.\r\r\n» The administration of the product by the subcutaneous route at the recommended dosage of 40 mg/kg florfenicol maintained efficacious plasma levels in cattle (i.e. above the MIC90 of the least sensitive respiratory pathogen, Mannheimia haemolytica) for longer than 39 hours. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)of approximately 4.3 µg/ml occurred approximately 5.5 hours (Tmax) after dosing.\r\r\n» After administration of the product by the subcutaneous route at the recommended dosage of 2.2 mg/kg flunixin peak plasma concentrations of 2.9 µg/ml were achieved after 1.3 hours. The volume of distribution was approximately 2 litres per kg.\r\r\n» The binding of florfenicol on proteins is approximately 20% and for flunixin > 99%. The degree of elimination of florfenicol residues in urine is approximately 68% and in faeces approximately 8%. The degree of elimination of flunixin residues in urine is approximately 34% and for faeces approximately 57%.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n100 ml and 250 ml glass Type I vials closed with a bromobutyl stopper and aluminium cap.

Following diffusion through the outer cell membrane, oxytetracyclineis actively transported to the inner cytoplasmicmembrane. It binds to receptors on the 30 S subunit of the bacterial ribosomes and interferes with the binding to the aminoacyl-transfer RNA in the messenger RNA ribosome complex. This blocks the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain and inhibits protein synthesis. Only a small portion of the drug is irreversibly bound and it appears that the reversibly bound antibiotic is responsible for antibacterial action.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\n- Absorption: Oxytetracycline is rapidly absorbed from the injection site with peak plasma levels within 2-6 hours. Therapeutic plasma levels are maintained for 48-72 hours post treatment.\r\r\n- Distribution: Oxytetracycline diffuses throughout the body and is found in the highest concentration in kidney, liver, spleen and lung. It is also deposited at active sites of ossification. Oxytetracycline passes through the bovine placenta and enters the foetal circulation. The concentration in the foetal blood is approximately one half that in the maternal blood. Oxtetracycline diffuses with difficulty into the cerebrospinal fluid.\r\r\n- Metabolism/Biotransformation: Oxytetracycline undergoes metabolism to various degrees. The most frequently identified substance in urine, faeces and tissues is the parent tetracycline. As much as 30% will be excreted unchanged in the faeces. Oxytetracycline is reversibly bound to plasma protein and widely distributed. It is removed from blood by the liver and high concentrations are achieved in parenchyma and bile. Bile concentrations may be 30 times that of blood.

The mechanism of action is thought to be due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.\r\r\n» Ivermectin acts by inhibiting nerve impulses. It binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyper-polarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites.\r\r\n» Clorsulon is rapidly absorbed into the circulating blood. Erythrocytes with bound drug as well as plasma are ingested by Fasciola spp. Adult Fasciola spp. are killed by clorsulon because of inhibition of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, which is their primary source of energy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n• Curamenth is used for the treatment and control of nitroxynil, ivermectin and clorsulon sensitive strains of internal and external parasites of cattle and triclabendazole resistant strains of early immature (including 2-week old stages), immature and adult liver fluke.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Curamenth is effective against sensitive strains of the following internal parasites:\r\r\n- Gastro-intestinal roundworms:\r\r\n> Adult and immature:\r\r\n• Ostertagia ostertagi - Small brown stomach worms (including third and fourth stage larvae and inhibited immatures).\r\r\n• Haemonchus placei - Barber's pole worm.\r\r\n• Trichostrongylus axei - Stomach hair worm (including third and fourth stage larvae).\r\r\n• Trichostrongylus colubriformis - Intestinal hair worm.\r\r\n• O. lyrata - Stomach worm.\r\r\n• Cooperia spp - Small intestinal worm (including third and fourth stage larvae).\r\r\n• Oesophagostomum radiatum - Nodule worm (including third and fourth stage larvae).\r\r\n• Bunostomum phlebotomum - (including third and fourth stage larvae).\r\r\n\r\r\n> Adult stages of:\r\r\n• Trichuris spp - Whipworm.\r\r\n• Strongyloides papillosus - Intestinal worm.\r\r\n• Nematodirus spp. - Thin necked intestinal worm.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Immature (6-week old), Immature and Adult Liver Fluke: Fasciola hepatica.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Lungworms: Dictyocaulus viviparus (adult and immature, including inhibited stages).\r\r\n\r\r\n- Eyeworm: Thelazia spp (adult stages).\r\r\n\r\r\n- Sucking Lice:\r\r\n• Linognathus vituli - Long nosed sucking louse.\r\r\n• Haematopinus eurysternus - Short nosed sucking louse.\r\r\n• Solenopotes capillatus - Little blue sucking louse.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabei var bovis.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Screw Worm Fly: Chrysomya bezziana (parasitic larval stages.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Cattle tick: Boophilus microplus.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen used as directed for control of internal parasites of cattle, Curamenth concurrently aids in control of:\r\r\n- Mites: Chorioptes bovis.\r\r\n- Biting Lice: Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis.\r\r\n\r\r\nSustained activity:\r\r\nCuramenth effectively controls infection with Ostertagia spp. and Cooperia spp. acquired up to 7 days after treatment, and Dictyocaulus viviparous and Chrysomya bezziana acquired up to 14 days after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n- 1.5 ml / 50 kg body weight, by subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n- If required the dose can be divided and administered in two sites.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nNot to be used intravenously or intramuscularly.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effect:\r\r\n- Curamenth has been shown to be safe in cattle when used as directed.\r\r\n- Pregnant and breeding cattle may be treated provided normal care is taken in handling.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions & Warnings:\r\r\n- Avoid overdosing of cattle.\r\r\n- Do not retreat cattle for 120 days after the last treatment.\r\r\n- Care should be taken when administering Curamenth or other medications to sick debilitated animals in poor condition\r\r\n- If product leaks from the injection site staining of the coat of light colored cattle may occur for a period of several weeks.\r\r\n- Gloves are recommended during usage.\r\r\n- Not to be used in recently born pet animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo avoid carcass damage:\r\r\n- Use shortest needle possible, certainly not exceeding 15 mm.\r\r\n- As far as possible avoid injection of animals during wet weather or under dusty conditions.\r\r\n- This product should be injected only under the skin.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period:\r\r\n- Meat: 56 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Do not use in cattle which are producing or may in the future produce milk where the milk or milk products may be used for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\n- Store at a temperature not exceeding 30°C, away from light.\r\r\n- Used within 3 months after opening when stored at temperature not exceeding 30°C, away from light.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nCartoon box containing amber glass vials (Type II) of 100 ml injectable solution closed with chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Type I) and aluminum cap + label and insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nADWIA Co.

        "description": "Composition:\r\r\nEach 100 ml contains\r\r\n- Butaphosphan  10 gm\r\r\n- Cyanocobalamin (1-(n-Butylamino)-1-methylethylphosphonous acid  0.005 gm\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties:\r\r\n- Vitamin B12 is a collective term for the Cobalamins of which cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin are the principle compounds. They are cobalt-containing water soluble vitamins ruminants are able to use cobalt to synthesis Vitamin B12 in the rumen and deficiency occurs when inadequate cobalt is present in the diet.\r\r\n- Cyanocobalamin is used for treating deficiencies of Vitamin B12. Malabsorption of nutrients secondary to gastrointestinal tract disease or dietary chromium deficiencies (in ruminants) can be associated with dietary deficiencies of vitamin B12.\r\r\n- In carnivores vitamin B12 deficiency may occur as a result or inadequate absorption of the vitamin from Gl tract or increased body requirements.\r\r\n- Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA svnthesis. Deficiency causes inhibited nuclear maturation and division. RBC maturation arrest in the bone marrow leads pernicious anemia. Clinical signs of deficiency include anorexia, unthriftiness, anemia and in coordination.\r\r\n- Butaphosphan is an organic source of phosphorus and is a key component in energy and protein metabolism and also as a structural part of bone. Phosphorus is essential for many interstitial processes, notably glycolysis, membrane maintenance, oxygen transport, muscle contraction and protection from oxidative damage. It is also an important component of bones, teeth, milk, and ruminant saliva. Deficiency is usually primary and results in multi-organ system dysfunction and eventually progressive demineralization of bone.\r\r\n- Acute phosphorus deficiency is uncommon in farm animals but may be encountered in older beef suckler cows during the first 6 weeks of lactation.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nAlexcafo is indicated for:\r\r\n- Metabolic disorders resulting from poor nutrition, inadequate management, or diseases.\r\r\n- Development and nutritional disorders in young animals due to rearing diseases.\r\r\n- Metaphylaxis of infertility and puerperal diseases and support of sterility treatment.\r\r\n- Tetanies and pareses in addition to Ca and Mg therapy.\r\r\n- As a roborant in cases of stress, overexertion, exhaustion and reduced resistance.\r\r\n- As a tonic in cases of weakness, secondary anaemia and chilling.\r\r\n- Support of muscular physiology.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget animals: horse, cattle, foals, calves, sheep, goat, lamb, pigs, dogs, cats.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\nAdministered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously\r\r\n- Horse, catte: 10-25 ml\r\r\n- Foals, calves: 5-12 ml\r\r\n- Sheep, goat: 2.5-8 ml\r\r\n- Lamb: 1.5-2.5 ml\r\r\n- Pig (depending on weight): 2.5-10 ml\r\r\n- Suckling pig: 1-2.5 ml\r\r\n- Dog (depending on size): 0.5-5 ml\r\r\n- Cat and fur animals:  0.5-2.5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions\r\r\n- In acute cases treatment should be repeated daily if necessary\r\r\n- In chronic cases half the dose if necessary repetiion of 1 to 2 weeks or less\r\r\n- In healthy animals half the dose given\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects: None\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications: None\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal times: None\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C, after opening use within 4 weeks and store at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nA carton box containing amber glass type III bottle of 100 or 250 ml injectable solution with chlorobutyl rubber closure & aluminium cap, with outer label and an inner pamphlet.\r\r\n\r\r\nALEXANDRIA Co.

It is a newly launched member with a very different spectrum of activity – directed against liver flukes. It is very potent against liver flukes (Fasciola hepatica) from 1 day old early immature to adult. Triclabendazole acts by interrupting parasite energy metabolism by binding to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubular cell structure and preventing nutrient uptake and other functions. Triclabendazole acts primarily by binding to worms’ tubulin. Specifically it binds to dimeric tubulin, which, in turn, prevents the polymerization of tubulin during microtubule assembly. The earlier effects ascribed to triclabendazole, such as inhibition of fumarate reductase activity, may be secondary to the disruption of microtubules, which are essential for secretion of many enzymes.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Cattle : For the treatment and control of liver fluke infections in cattle caused by all stages of triclabendazole susceptible Fasciola hepatica from 2 week old immature to adult fluke.\r\r\n- Sheep : For the treatment and control of liver fluke infections in sheep caused by all stages of triclabendazole susceptible Fasciola hepatica from 2 day old immature to adult fluke.\r\r\n\r\r\nDose:\r\r\nFor active ingredient:\r\r\n- Cattle: 12 mg of triclabendazole / kg.b.wt.\r\r\n- Sheep: 10 mg of triclabendazole / kg.b.wt.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor whole product:\r\r\n- Cattle : 12 ml of Triclafluke suspension / 100 kg.b.wt. to be given orally as a single dose.\r\r\n- Sheep: 10 ml of Triclafluke suspension / 100 kg.b.wt. to be given orally as a single dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n- Although triclabendazole is highly effective against all liver stages of Fasciola. - - Liver fluke resistant to triclabendazole have recently been found.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-indication:\r\r\n- Not used for dairy cattle producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Not used for dairy cattle and sheep after the start of dry period.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide-effects:\r\r\n- None at therapeutic doses.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal periods:\r\r\n- Meat of cattle: 56 days.\r\r\n- Meat of sheep: 35 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacks: 500, 1000 & 4500 ml.",

Oxytetracycline has a bacteriostatic action against a large number of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms, Rickettsia, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Actinomyces and some blood protozoa.\r\r\n- The bacteriostatic effect is based on the inhibition of the synthesis of bacterial protein. Oxytetracycline penetrates very rapidly into the blood and tissues with high concentration and relatively a high percentage of oxytetracycline is bound to serum proteins, therapeutic levels remain in the body for long times.\r\r\n- Bromhexine is a mucolytic agent which aims to make bronchial secretions easier to propel by ciliary action to expel by coughing and in this way reduce cough frequency. It is also of value in achieving liquefaction and improving flow characteristics of mucus by increasing volume and decreasing viscosity.\r\r\n- It is suggested that bromhexine improves lysosomal function and that lysosomal enzymes hydrolyze the mucopolysaccharide fibers of mucus.\r\r\n- The advantage of bromhexine is that brings about an increase in the content of immunoglobulin and Oxytetracycline in bronchial secretions, presumably by increasing membrane permeability.\r\r\n- The addition of bromhexine to oxytetracycline (OxyClear) significantly increases the sputum concentration of oxytetracycline which is cleared from plasma more effectively in the presence of bromhexine. So combination of bromhexine with oxytetracycline proves of value in the treatment of certain pulmonary Infections.\r\r\n- The antibiotic activity is enhanced due to the synergistic action of bromhexine so bromhexine increases the efficacy of oxytetracycline against respiratory infections.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nOxyClear is indicated for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections caused by oxytetracycline sensitive G-ve and G+ve bacteria as well as Rickettsia, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, especially in cases of retained mucoid secretions in Cattle and buffaloes.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Cattle and buffaloes: 1ml / 10kg .B.wt ( 5 mg Oxytetracycline HCl + 0.3 mg Bromhexine HCl / kg.

The mechanism of action of the combination is based on a blocking sequential effect of the substances in the bacterial folic acid metabolism. The combination has an additive effect on intensity and thus allows a significant dose reduction of individual components.\r\r\n- The spectrum of action of the drug combination corresponds to the sulfonamides. The action is directed against accordingly numerous gram positive and gram negative bacteria (E. coli, Shigella spp, Klebsiella spp, Proteus vulgaris, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Pasteurella and Mannheimia species, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, Salmonella, etc.) and coccidiostatic against various Eimeria species (E. tenella, E. necatrix, E. maxima, E. brunetti, E. acervulina, etc.).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pharmacokinetic properties:\r\r\n- Both components of the combination are absorbed as wel as the individual substances after oral and parenteral administration. Maximum plasma levels are reached within about 1 to 8 hours.\r\r\n- The elimination half-lives move in a range of about 7 to 16 (up to 25) hours (sulfadoxine) or about 0.5 to 3 (up to 4) hours (Trimethoprim).

Dexamethasone has ten to twenty times the anti-inflammatory activity of prednisolone. Corticosteroids suppress the immunologic response by inhibition of dilatation of capillaries, migration and function of leucocytes and phagocytosis. Glucocorticoids have an effect on metabolism by increasing gluconeogenesis.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Horses, cattle, pigs, dogs and cats: Treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions.\r\r\n- Cattle: Treatment of primary ketosis (acetonaemia) and Induction of parturition.\r\r\n- Horses: Treatment of arthritis, bursitis or tenosynovitis.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nHorses, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n» Horses: For intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular.\r\r\n» Cattle, pigs, dogs and cats: For intramuscular injection.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions:\r\r\n- Horses, cattle, pigs: 1.5 ml / 50 kg\r\r\n- Dogs, cats: 0.5 ml / 10 kg\r\r\n• Doses may be repeated once after a 24-48 hours interval if required.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the treatment of primary ketosis in cattle (acetonaemia): 0.5 - 1 ml / 50 kg given by intramuscular injection, in most cases, a single dose will effect a cure but the dose may be repeated after 48 hours if necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the induction of parturition: 1 ml / 50 kg as a single intramuscular injection after day 260 of pregnancy. Parturition will normally occur within 48 - 72 hours. If calving does not occur within these periods, the dose may be repeated.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the treatment of arthritis, bursitis or tenosynovitis by single intra-articular in the horse: 1 - 5 ml, Injections into joint spaces or bursae should be preceded by the removal of an equivalent volume of synovial fluid. Strict asepsis is essential. To measure small volumes of less than 1 ml a suitably graduated syringe should be used to ensure accurate administration of the correct dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\n- An overdose can induce drowsiness and lethargy in horses.\r\r\n- Do not administer the product in pregnant females, except where the intentiontinal tract ulceration\r\r\n- Administration in late pregnancy is likely to cause abortion.\r\r\n- Use in lactating cows may cause a reduction in milk yield.\r\r\n- Concurrent use with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may exacerbate gastrointestinal tract ulceration.\r\r\n- Dexamethasone should not be used in combination with vaccines or within two weeks after vaccination.\r\r\n- Administration of dexamethasone may induce hypokalaemia and hence increase the risk of toxicity from cardiac glycosides. The risk of hypokalaemia may be increased if dexamethasone is administered together with potassium depleting diuretics.\r\r\n- Concurrent use with anticholinestaerase may lead to increased muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.\r\r\n- Glucocorticoids antagonise the effects of insulin.\r\r\n- Concurrent use with phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampicin can reduce the effects of dexamethason.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\n- If the veterinary medicinal product is used for induction of parturition in cattle, then a high incidence of retained placentas may be experienced and possible subsequent metritis and/or subfertility. Response to long term therapy should be monitored at regular intervals by a veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n- Use of corticosteroids in horses has been reported to induce laminitis.\r\r\n- Special care should be taken when the product is used in animals with a weakened immune system.\r\r\n- Except in cases of acetonaemia and induction of parturition, corticoid administration is to induce an improvement in clinical signs rather than a cure.\r\r\n- Following intra-articular administration, use of the joint should be minimized for one month and surgery on the joint should not be performed within eight weeks after use of this route of administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n- Do not use in viral infections during the viraemic stage or in cases of systemic mycotic infections.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals suffering from gastrointestinal or corneal ulcers, or demodicosis.\r\r\n- Do not administer intra-articularly where there is evidence of fractures, bacterial joint infections or aseptic bone necrosis.\r\r\n- Do not use in known cases of hypersensitivity to the active substance, to corticosteroids or to any other ingredient of the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse effects:\r\r\n- Steroids themselves, during treatment, may cause iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism (Cushings disease) involving significant alteration of fat, carbohydrate, protein and mineral metabolism, e.g. redistribution of body fat, increase in body weight, muscle weakness and wastage and osteoporosis may result.\r\r\n- During therapy effective doses suppress the hypothalamo-pituitreal adrenal axis. Following cessation of treatment, signs of adrenal insufficiency extending to adrenocortical atrophy can arise and this may render the animal unable to deal adequately with stressful situations.\r\r\n- Consideration should therefore be given to means of minimizing problems of adrenal insufficiency following the withdrawal of treatment.\r\r\n- Systemically administered corticosteroids may cause polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia, particularly during the early stages of therapy.\r\r\n- Some corticosteroids may cause sodium and water retention and hypokalaemia in long term use.\r\r\n- Systemic corticosteroids have caused deposition of calcium in the skin (calcinosis cutis).\r\r\n- Corticosteroids use may delay wound healing and the immunosuppressant actions may weaken resistance to or exacerbate existing infections.\r\r\n- In the presence of bacterial infections concurrent antibacterial therapy is usually required in the presence of viral infections, corticosteroids may worsen or hasten the progress of the disease.\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal ulceration has been reported in animals treated with corticosteroids and gastrointestinal ulceration may be exacerbated by steroids in patients given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and in animals with spinal cord trauma.\r\r\n- Corticosteroids use may cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) with increased serum hepatic enzymes and may increase the risk of acute pancreatitis. Other possible adverse reactions associated with corticosteroid use include retained placenta, metritis, subfertility, laminitis, reduction in milk yield, changes in blood biochemical and haematological parameters.\r\r\n- Transient hyperglycaemia can occur.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n  Meat: 8 days\r\r\n  Milk: 3 days\r\r\nPig Meat: 2 days\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Conditions:\r\r\n- Store at a temperature not exceeding 30°C and use after opening for 3 months to be stored at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n- Shelf life: 3 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacks:\r\r\nCartoon box containing amber glass vials (Type II) of 100 ml injectable solution with chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Type I) and aluminum cap + label & insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nADWIA Co.

This is the result of this class of drugs giving rise to hypoglycaemia in the host. Babesia as well as many other parasites like trypanosomes depends upon host glucose for aerobic glycolysis.

The inadequate formation of the bacterial wall in the susceptible species produces an osmotic unbalance that affects especially bacteria in growth phase (during which the processes of synthesis of the bacterial wall are especially important) that finally induces the bacterial cell lysis.\r\r\n\r\r\nAction spectrum:\r\r\nAmong the species considered sensitive to amoxicillin the following stand out:\r\r\n• Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus not producers of penicillinase, streptococci (Streptococcus suis), clostridia (Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium spp.), Arcanobacterium spp., Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\r\r\n• Gram-negative bacteria: Pasteurella spp., Mannheimia haemolytica, Haemophilus spp..Actinobacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Moraxella spp., Fusobacterium spp.\r\r\n- There is complete cross-resistance between amoxicillin and other penicillins, particularly other aminopenicillins (ampicillin).\r\r\n- Amoxicillin presents a low bond to plasmatic proteins and diffuses quickly to most of corporal liquids and tissues. This diffusion spreads to synovial discharges, expectoration liquids and the lymphatic tissue. The diffusion is more satisfactory in liquids resulting from an inflammatory process.\r\r\n- Amoxicillin metabolism limits to the opening of the beta-lactam ring by hydrolysis, which induces the release of the inactive penicilloyl acid (20%). Biotransformations take place in liver.\r\r\n- Amoxicillin is mainly distributed in the extracellular compartment. Its distribution towards tissues is facilitated by the weak bond index to the plasmatic proteins.\r\r\n- The main way of elimination for amoxicillin is renal in active form. It is also excreted in small amounts by milk and bile.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS & TARGET SPECIES\r\r\nBovine, ovine, pigs, dogs and cats: Infectious processes caused by microorganisms sensitive to amoxicillin, located in: Digestive tract, respiratory tract, urogenital tract, skin and soft tissues; as well as bacterial complications sensitive to amoxicillin in diseases that require it.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Administration: Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n- Inject 1 ml of AMOXOIL RETARD per 15-30 Kg body weight.\r\r\n- It is advisable not last the treatment more than 5-7 days. If an improvement is not observed in the first 48 hours, reconsider diagnostic. The dose and/or frequency can be increased at the veterinary discretion.\r\r\n- To assure a correct dosage, the weight of animals must be determined previously the use.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- In front of any infectious process, it is advisable the bacteriological confirmation of diagnosis and to carry out a sensitivity test of the bacterium causing the process.\r\r\n- Adjust dose in animals with renal dysfunctions. Shake the product well before use. Use sterile and dry syringes. Massage gently on the injection site. Do not administer by intravenous injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not administer to animals with a background of hypersensitivity to penicillins.\r\r\n- Do not administer by oral route to rabbits, guinea-pigs and hamsters due to amoxicillin, as all aminopenicillins, has an important action on the cecal bacterial population.\r\r\n- Do not administer to equidae due to amoxicillin, as all aminopenicillins, has an important action on the cecal bacterial population.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\nSensitization reactions which seriousness may vary from a simple urticaria to an anaphylactic shock. Local reaction on the injection site. Gastrointestinal symptomatology, mainly in herbivores. Super intections by no sensitive microorganism after long use. Occasionally haematic dyscrasias and colitis can appear.\r\r\n\r\r\nGESTATION AND LACTATION\r\r\nIt can be used during gestation. Category B of FDA.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nDo not administer together with antibiotics that inhibit the bacterial protein synthesis because of they can antagonize the bactericide action of penicillins.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSAGE\r\r\nIt has a wide margin of safety. In case that some intense allergic reactions appear, stop the treatment and administer corticoids and adrenaline. In other cases, administer a symptomatic treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat: 14 days.\r\r\n- Milk: 3 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 25°C, in dry place, away from light and to be used immediately after opening.\r\r\n\r\r\nSUPPLY\r\r\nVials of 10, 50, 100 and 250 ml.\r\r\n\r\r\nKeep the product out of the reach of children\r\r\n\r\r\nDistributed in Egypt by:\r\r\nTABA MEDICAL PHARMA\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nlaboratorios syva s.a.u.\r\r\nAvda.

This has to do with the fact that horses can no longer be dewormed preventively, but can only be treated when your horse is actually diagnosed with worms. This diagnosis can be made on the basis of a coprological examination.\r\r\n \r\r\nActive ingredient;\r\r\n18,92 mg Moxidectin, this is enough to deworm a horse with a maximum of 700 kg bodyweight.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndication:\r\r\nEquest® Tape is palatable and effective for the treatment and control of:\r\r\n- Tapeworm: Anoplocephala perfoliata, Anoplocephala magna and Paranoplocephala mamillana.\r\r\n- Large Strongyles: Strongylus vulgaris (adults, L3 and L4 arterial stages), Strongylus edentatus (adults and L4 visceral larval stages), Strongylus equinus (adults), Triodontophorus spp. (adults) including T. brevicauda,\r\r\n- T. serratus and T. tenuicollis, Craterostomum acuticaudatum (adults).\r\r\n- Small Strongyles (adults): Cyathostomum spp. including C. catinatum and C. pateratum; Cylicostephanus spp. including C. calicatus, C. goldi; C. longibursatus and C. minutus, Cylicocyclus spp. including C. brevicapsulatus,\r\r\n- C. elongatus, C. insigne, C. leptostomum, C. nassatus, C. radiatus, C. ashworthi and C. ultrajectinus; Cylicodontophorus bicoronatus; Coronocyclus spp. including C. coronatus, C. labiatus and C. labratus; Gyalocephalus capitatus; Parapoteriostomum mettami; Peterovinema poculatus; Poteriostomum imparidentatum, as well as benzimidazole resistant strains.\r\r\n- Pinworms: Oxyurus equi (adults and L3/L4 larval stages). Ascarids: Parascaris equorum (adults and intestinal stages (L4)). Hairworms: Trichostrongylus axei (adults).\r\r\n- Intestinal Threadworms: Strongyloides westeri.\r\r\n- Large Mouthed Stomach Worms: Habronema spp. – gastric and cutaneous (summer sore) forms. Stomach Bots: Gasterophilus intestinalis (2 & 3 stage larvae), Gasterophilus nasalis (2 & 3 stage larvae). Cutaneous Onchocerciasis: Onchocerca spp. (microfiliariae).\r\r\n\r\r\nHow does Equest Oral Gel work?\r\r\nThe active ingredient in Equest Oral Gel is moxidectin. Moxidectin is an anti-parasitical medicine that is comparable to ivermectin. There a couple important differences. The difference is mainly in the effect that the medicine has on marsh worms and the so called ‘sleeping larva’. For this, products with moxidectin as active ingredient are a better choice than deworming products with ivermectin as active ingredient.\r\r\nEquest Oral Gel can be safely used to treat pregnant mares, but cannot be used to treat foal younger than 4 months.\r\r\n \r\r\nWhy Equest Oral Gel?\r\r\nEquest Oral Gel is a very effective product against parasites amongst horses, internal as well as external. Think about worms like Parascaris (nematode), foal worms, roundworms, arse worms and horsefly larva. Equest Oral Gel is also a good product to use when you want to prevent benzimidazole (fenbendazole) resistant Cyathostomin, also known as the marsh worm amongst horses.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow do you use Equest Oral Gel?\r\r\nEquest Oral Gel can only be used on recommendation of a veterinarian. For treatment with this medicine you need to have a prescription.\r\r\nOne whole injector (14,8 gr with 18,92 Moxidectin) is to deworm a horse with 700 kg bodyweight. Per kg bodyweight of your horse, you need to administer 0,4 mg moxidectin.\r\r\nWashing your hands after administering Equest Oral Gel is advisable.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdvise;\r\r\nNot to administered on foal younger than 4 months.\r\r\nNot to administered in case of known over-sensitiveness for the active ingredient, any other milbemycin or another element of the medicine.\r\r\n\r\r\nWaiting time;\r\r\n(Organ)Meat; 32 days",

Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nEquiveen is indicated for the treatment of parasitic infestations due to:\r\r\n1.

        "description": "Ainil ketoprofen (INN) is an injectable solution for Intravenous or intramuscular route for veterinary use only.\r\r\n\r\r\nComposition:\r\r\n- Ketoprofen 100 mg\r\r\n- Benzyl alcohol 10 mg\r\r\n- Excipient q.s. 1 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties:\r\r\n- Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), non-narcotic agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties (QM01AE03).\r\r\n- Ketoprofen belongs to the generation of non-steroidal antinflammatory agents based on propionic acid.\r\r\n- Inflammatory stimulus that damage the cell activate phospholipases which deliver arachidonic acid. This is the substract of the cycloxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymatic systems, whose activity produce important mediators of inflammation: prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotriens.\r\r\n- Ketoprofen acts as double inhibitor of inflammation, blocking the cycloxygenase and also the lipoxygenase pathways and avoiding therefore tne prostaglandins and leukotriens production.\r\r\n- Furthermore ketoprofen is a potent analgesic with central and peripheral effects. Its action consists on inhibiting directly bradykinin, a vasodilator and pain mediator. Bradykinin begins the painful stimulus by exciting nociceptor nerve ends. Besides its antibradykinin activity, ketoprofen acts at the central nervous system to inhibit the pain perception. Moreover, in the horse, ketoprofen counteracts the endotoxin effect and antagonizes the intestinal spasm induced by bradykinin.\r\r\n- Ketoprofen is rapidly absorbed. In bovine, the peak plasma levels (8.025 ±1.9 mg /ml) are reached in less than one hour after intramuscular administration and bioavailability is almost complete. It is over 98% bound to plasma proteins and it is concentrated in inflammed tissues. It has a high affinity with synovial tissues, it is rapidly distributed and eliminated.\r\r\n- Duration of action is longer than expected by it's half-life which varies from less than one hour (IV route in horses) and more than five hours (after IM administration in cattle).

Its action is exerted on bacterial reductase which transforms folic acid to folinic acid. Absence of this latter halts methionine synthesis and that of purine and pyrimidine base which are used to form nucleic acids.\r\r\n» Sulphamethoxypyridazine acts as a competitive inhibitor of para-amino-benzoic acid (PABA), which is necessary for the bacterial growth.

Cattle- treats liver fluke, gastrointestinal worms, lungworms, eyeworms, cattle grubs, mites and lice. Sheep- treats liver fluke, gastrointestinal worms, trematodes, lungworm, nasal bots and mites.\r\r\n\r\r\nActive Ingredient per ml:\r\r\n- 5 mg Ivermectin,\r\r\n- 125 mg Closantel (as Closantel sodium dihydrate)\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties:\r\r\nIvermectin is an endectocide with activity against a wide range of internal and external parasites. It enhances the release of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) at presynaptic neurons. GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter and blocks the post-synaptic stimulation of the adjacent neuron in nematodes or the muscle fiber in arthropods. By stimulating the release of GABA, ivermectin causes paralysis of the parasite and eventual death.\r\r\n\r\r\nClosantel is a member of the salicylanilide class of anthelmintics. Salicylanilides are hydrogen ionophores which act as potent uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. The site of action of these proton ionophores is known to be selective uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in parasite mitochondria.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nFor the treatment of mixed trematode (fluke) and nematode or arthropod infestations due to gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, eyeworms, warbles, mites and lice of cattle.

Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n» Clorsulon: Clorsulon is rapidly absorbed into the circulating blood. Erythrocytes with bound drug as well as plasma are ingested by Fasciola spp. Adult Fasciola spp. are killed by clorsulon because of inhibition of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, which is their primary source of energy.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS:\r\r\n» Gastrointestinal Roundworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia spp. (including inhibited O. ostertagi), Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei ,Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia spp., Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult only), Nematodirus helvetianus (adult only), Nematodirus spathiger (adult only), Toxocara vitulorum, Trichuris spp. (adult only).\r\r\n» Lungworm (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n» Liver Fluke (adult): Fasciola hepatica.\r\r\n» Eye Worms (adult): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n» Warbles (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatum.\r\r\n» Mange mites: Psoroptes bovis ,Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis.\r\r\n» Sucking Lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eursternus, Solenopotes capllatus.\r\r\n\r\r\n» The veterinary medicinal product may also be used as an aid in the control of biting lice (Damalinia bovis) and the mange mite Chorioptes bovis, but complete elimination may not occur.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Persistent Activity: When cattle have to graze on pasture contaminated with infective larvae of cattle nematodes, treatment with the product at the recommended dose rate can control re-infection with Haemonchus placei and Cooperia spp., acquired up to 14 days after treatment, Ostertagia ostertagi and Oesophagostomum radiatum acquired up to 21 days after treatment and Dictyocalus viviparus acquired up to 28 days after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES: Cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSE AND ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\n» For active ingredient: 200 mcg ivermectin plus 2 mg clorsulon per kg bodyweight.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For whole product: 1 ml per 50 kg bodyweight. The product should be given only by subcutaneous injection under the loose skin in front of, or behind, the shoulder.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Divide doses greater than 10 ml between two injection sites. A sterile 17 gauge 1/2 inch (15 - 20 mm) needle is recommended.\r\r\n» When the temperature of the product is below 5°C, difficulty in administration may be encountered due to increased viscosity. Warming the product and injection equipment to about 15°C will greatly increase the ease with which the product can be injected.\r\r\n» Different injection sites should be used for other parenteral products.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE:\r\r\nThe administration of 5 ml per 50kg bodyweight (5 X the recommended dose rate.) resulted in injection site lesions (including swelling, sensitivity, edema and inflammation).

A\r\r\ndosing programs should be established by the veterinary surgeon. Veterinary advice should be sought on appropriate dosing programs and stock management to achieve adequate parasite control, and to reduce the likelihood of anthelmintic resistance developing. Veterinary advice should also be sought if the product does not achieve the desired clinical effect, as other diseases, nutritional disturbances or anthelmintic resistance might be involved. Frequent and repeated use may lead to the development of resistance. It is important that the correct dose is given in order to minimize the risk of resistance. To ensure administration of a correct dose, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible. The accuracy of the dosing device should be checked. If animals are to be treated. Collectively rather than individually they should be grouped according to their bodyweight and dosed accordingly, in order to avoid under or overdosing. Ivermectin may not be well tolerated in non-target species. Cases or intolerance resulting in fatalities have been reported in dogs, especially Collies, Old English Sheep Dogs and related breeds or crosses, and also in turtles/tortoises. Divide doses in excess of 10 ml between different injection sites and use different sites to those used for other parenteral medications Swab septum before removing each dose. Avoid the introduction of contamination during use. For the 50 ml pack size, the use of a multidose syringe is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Precautions for the person:\r\r\n- Do not eat, drink or smoke while handling the product.\r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n- Take care to avoid self-administration; the product may cause local irritation and/or pain at the site of injection.

It binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligandgated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels. The macrocyclic lactones have low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n- Ivermectin is effective against a wide range of nematode species and developmental stages, but has no activity against trematodes or cestodes.\r\r\n- They are termed endectocides because they are also active against many ectoparasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n» Cattle: For the treatment of gastrointestinal nematodes, lungworms, eyeworms, warble flies, mites and lice (as shown below) of beef and non-lactating dairy cattle:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal worms (adults and 4th stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi Ostertagia lyrata, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora (adults), Cooperia punctata (adults), Cooperia pectinata (adults), Bunostomuma phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum.\r\r\n- Lungworms (adult and 4th stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n- Eyeworms (adult): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n- Warble flies (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatum\r\r\n- Mites: Psoroptes ovis, Sarcoptes scabiel var, bovis.\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n\r\r\n• May also be used as an aid in the control of the mange mite Chorioptes bovis but complete elimination may not occur.\r\r\n• Treatment at the recommended dose rate prevents re-infection with Haemonchus placel, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia pectinata and Trichostrongylus axel for 7 days after treatment, Ostertagia ostertagi and Oesophagostomum radiatum for treatment and Dictyocaulus viviparus for 21 days days after after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep:\r\r\nFor the treatment of psoroptic mange (sheep scab), gastrointestinal nematodes, lungworms and nasal bots of sheep.\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adults): Ostertagia circumcincta, Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis and T. vitrinus, Cooperia curticei, Nematodirus filicollis.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Variable activity may be observed against Cooperio curticei and Nematodirus filicollis.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Lungworms: Dictyocaulus filaria (adults).\r\r\n- Mange mites: Psoroptes ovis.\r\r\n- Nasal bot: Oestrus ovis (all larval stages).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs:\r\r\nFor the treatment of gastro-intestinal nematodes. lungworms, lice and mange mites of pigs.\r\r\n- Gastro-intestinal worms (adult and fourth stage larvae): Ascaris sum, Hyostrongylus rubidus, Oesophagostomum spp, Strongyloides ransomi (adults).\r\r\n- Lungworms: Metastrongylus spp. (adults).\r\r\n- Lice: Haematopinus suis.\r\r\n- Mange Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species:\r\r\nCattle, sheep and pigs.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n• By S/C injection only.\r\r\n- Cattle & sheep: 1 ml / 50 kg B.W.\r\r\n- Pigs: 1 ml / 33 kg B.W.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions:\r\r\n- Not combine treatment with vaccination against lungworms. If vaccinated animals are to be treated. treatment should not be carried out within a period of 28 days before or after vaccination.\r\r\n- In Cattle: To avoid secondary reactions due to the death of Hypoderma larvae in the oesophagus or in the spine, it is recommended to administer the product at the end of warble fly activity and before the larvae reach their resting sites.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-Indications:\r\r\n- Do not use in lactating dairy cows and sheep producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Do not use in non-lactating dairy cows, including pregnant dairy heifers or non-lactating dairy sheep within 60 days of calving/lambing.\r\r\n- Do not use in cases of known hypersensitivity to ivermectin.\r\r\n- Do not administer by the intravenous or intramuscular route.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects:\r\r\n- Transitory discomfort has been observed in some animals immediately following subcutaneous administration.\r\r\n- In cattle this may include jumping and rolling, but behaviour returns to normal after 15 minutes.\r\r\n- Soft tissue swelling and thickening of the skin at the injection site has been observed in treated animals.\r\r\n- Typically these reactions are transient and disappear within one to four weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Time:\r\r\nMeat and offal:\r\r\n- Sheep: 42 days\r\r\n- Cattle: 49 days.\r\r\n- Pigs: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C and used after opening for 50 days at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nAmber glass vial: 10, 30, 50, 100 & 500 ml.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nArab Company For Medical Products (ARABCOMED)\r\r\nObour City - Industrial Area - Cairo - Egypt",

Moxidectin interacts with GABA receptors and chloride channels. The net effect is to open the chloride channels on the postsynaptic junction to allow the inflow of chloride ions and induce an irreversible resting state. This results in flaccid paralysis and eventual death of parasites exposed to the drug.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nIn cattle weighing from 100 to 500 kg body weight, treatment and prevention of mixed infestations by the following gastrointestinal nematodes, respiratory nematodes, and certain arthropod parasites:\r\r\n\r\r\n- Adult and immature gastro-intestinal nematodes: Haemonchus placei, Haemonchus contortus. Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited larvae). Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Nematodirus helvetianus (adults only), Nematodirus spathiger.

Hypodermalineatum.\r\r\n- Lice: Linognathus vituli. Haematopinus eurysternus. Solenopotes capillatus.Bovicolabovis (aid in control).\r\r\n- Mange mites: Sarcoptes scabiei. Psoroptes ovis. Chorioptes bovis (aid in control).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nDosage is 0.5 ml/50 kg bodyweight, equivalent to 1 mg moxidectin / kg body weight, given by a single subcutaneous injection in the ear using an 18 gauge, 25– 40 mm hypodermic needle.\r\r\n\r\r\n- The injection site is approximately 3.5 cm distal to the distal edge of the ear cartilage.\r\r\n- Use one hand to grasp and steady the ear. Inject subcutaneously.\r\r\n- Inject contents. Depot should be just distal to the distal edge of the auricular cartilage. Apply pressure at the point of insertion as the needle is withdrawn from the skin to help seal the opening.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in animals less than 100 kg bodyweight or greater than 500 kg.\r\r\n- Do not inject the product by the intravascular route. The intravascular injection may result in ataxia, paralysis, convulsions, collapse, and death.\r\r\n- To prevent any intravascular injection, carefully follow the administration procedure.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL TIME\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 108 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not permitted for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption or industrial purposes or within 80 days of expected parturition.

Bicarbonate and citrate also enhance the absorption of water and sodium\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nEffydral solution corrects dehydration, electrolyte loss and metabolic acidosis, particularly when these disturbances arise as a consequence of diarrhoea. Effydral has been specially developed for the treatment of diarrhoea in calves.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nIf the gastro-intestinal tract is completely obstructed, great care should be taken when administering oral solutions.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- One litre of ready-to-use Effydral solution is prepared by adding one effervescent tablet to 1 litre lukewarm (circa 37 C) water. The solution should be made up freshly just prior to feeding, using clean water and equipment.\r\r\n- Treatment should commence as soon as diarrhoea is noticed. Instead of feeding milk or milk replacer, feed 2 or 3 litres of Effydral solution twice daily for two days. During the next two days, feed 1 or 1.5 litres Effydral solution, mixed with an equal quantity of milk or milk replacer. Normal feeding can then usually be resumed.\r\r\n- In cases of severe dehydration, the Effydral solution should be administered in 3 or 4 feeds per day. If necessary, Effydral solution can be administered by stomach tube. If necessary, Effydral solutions can be fed exclusively for up to 4 days without harmful effects.\r\r\n- Use of a too-dilute Effydral solution will have a reduced efficacy while use of a too-concentrated solution may result in osmotic diarrhoea. If a too-concentrated solution is fed, ensure that the animal has free access to drinking water.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf-life:\r\r\nAs packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage:\r\r\nDo not store above 25 C. Once dissolved in water store in a refrigerator (2 C - 8 C) for up to 24 hours. Any medicated water which is not consumed within 24 hours should be discarded.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nbox contains 48 tablets packed in 6 x 8 tablets.",

The dorsal (outer) surface of the ear should first be cleansed with antiseptic and allowed to briefly air dry. Palpate the edge of the auricular cartilage closest to the head, on the dorsal (hairy) surface of the ear. From this landmark, taking care to avoid blood vessels (artery, vein), the needle should be inserted subcutaneously starting at a point approximately 3 to 3.5 cm distal to this edge (away from the head), and directed towards the base of the ear, and the needle advanced to the hub. At this point, gently aspirate the syringe to confirm that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Upon injection, the resulting depot should reside just distal to the edge of the auricular cartilage. Following administration, the needle is withdrawn from the skin as pressure is applied for several seconds with the thumb at the point of insertion.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 104 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not permitted for use in dairy sheep, at any stage of life.\r\r\n- The withdrawal period is based solely on a single injection at the base of the ear.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n- First opening the packaging: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.

The product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATION(S)\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n1. Provides effective control against the following parasites of cattle.\r\r\n» Gastro-intestinal worms (adult and fourth stage larvae): Ostertagia spp (Including inhibited O. ostertagi), Haemonochus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia spp, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult), Nematodirus helvetianus (adult), N. spathiger (adult), Trichuris spp. (adult).\r\r\n» Lungworms (adult and fourth stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n» Eyeworms (adult): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n» Warbles (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis and H. lineatum.\r\r\n» Mange mites: Psoroptes bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis.\r\r\n» Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurystermus and Solenopotes capillatus.\r\r\n\r\r\n2. May also be used as an aid in the control of the mange mite Chorioptes bovis but complete elimination may not occur. When cattle have to graze on pasture contaminated with infective larvae of cattle nematodes, treatment at the recommended dose rate controls re-infection with Haemonchus placei, and Cooperia spp. acquired up to 14 days after treatment, Ostertagia ostertagi and Oesphagostomum radiatum acquired up to 21 days after treatment and Dictyocaulus viviparus acquired up to 28 days after treatment. To obtain optimal benefit from the persistent activity of the product for grazing animals, it is recommended that calves which are set stocked in their first grazing season should be treated 3, 8 and 13 weeks after the day of turn-out. This can protect the animals from parasitic gastro-enteritis and lungworm disease throughout the grazing season; provided they are set stocked in the programme and that no untreated cattle are added to the pasture. Treated calves should always be monitored according to good husbandry practices.\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep:\r\r\n» Gastrointestinal Roundworms (adult and fourth tage larvae): Ostertagia circumcincta (including nhibited fourth stage larvae), O. trifurcata, Haemonchus contortus (including inhibited fourth stage larvae), Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia curticei, Oesphagostomum columbianum, Nematodirus filicollis, Chabertia ovina, Trichostron gylus. axei (adult), T. vitrinus (adult), Oesphagosto mum venulosum (adult), Trichuris ovis (adult).\r\r\n» Lung worms (adult and fourth stage): Dictyocaulus filaria, Protostrongylus rufescens (adult).\r\r\n» Nasal bots (adult immature): Oestrus ovis (includes somatic larval stages).\r\r\n\r\r\nPigs:\r\r\n» Gastro-intestinal roundworms (adults and fourth stage larvae): Ascaris suum, Hyostrongylus containerrubidus, Oesophagostomum spp. and adult and somatic larval stages of Strongyloides ransomi.\r\r\n» Lungworms: Metastrongylus spp. (adults).\r\r\n» Lice: Haematopinus suis.\r\r\n» Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in animals with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.\r\r\n- This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Cattle: Mild and transient discomfort has occasionally been observed in cattle following subcutaneous administration.

If animals are to be treated collectively rather than individually they should be grouped according to their bodyweight and dosed accordingly, in order to avoid under- or over-dosing. Each ml contains 10 mg of ivermectin sufficient to treat 50 kg of bodyweight of cattle and sheep and 33 kg of bodyweight of pigs.\r\r\n- The injection may be given with any standard automatic or single-dose or hypodermic syringe. Use of 17 gauge x ½ inch needle is suggested. Replace with a fresh sterile needle after every 10 to 12 animals. Injection of wet or dirty animals is not recommended. If using a single-dose or hypodermic syringe, use a separate sterile needle to withdraw the product from the container. Massage the injection site after administration of the product.\r\r\n- In young pigs, especially those below 16 kg for which less than 0.5 ml of the product is indicated, dosing accuracy is important. The use of a syringe that can accurately deliver as little as 0.1 ml is recommended. In young lambs weighing less than 20 kg give 0.1 ml per 5 kg. In these lambs the use of a syringe which can deliver as little as 0.1 ml is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\n» Cattle: Meat and offal: 49 days. Do not use in lactating cows producing milk for human consumption. Do not use in non-lactating dairy cows including pregnant dairy heifers within 60 days of calving.\r\r\n» Sheep: Meat and offal: 42 days. Do not use in lactating sheep producing milk for human consumption. Do not use in sheep within 60 days of lambing where milk is to be used for human consumption.\r\r\n» Pigs: Meat and offal: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the reach and sight of children.\r\r\n- Shelf life after first opening the container: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\n* Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintic from the same class. over an extended period of time.\r\r\n- Under dosing, which may be due to underestimation of body weight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device. Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintic should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the test(s) strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n* Resistance to ivermectin has been reported in Teladorsagia circumcincta in sheep and Ostertagia ostertag/ in cattle. Therefore, the use of this product should be based on local (regional, farm) epidemiological information about susceptibility of these helminth species and recommendations on how to limit further selection for resistance to anthelmintic.\r\r\n\r\r\n(i) Precautions for animals\r\r\n- The product has been formulated specifically for use in cattle, sheep and pigs. It should not be used in other species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may occur.\r\r\n\r\r\n(ii) Precautions for the Person\r\r\n- Take care to avoid self-administration: the product may cause local irritation and/or pain at the site of injection. Direct contact of the product with the skin should be kept to a minimum. Do not smoke or eat while handling the product. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\n(iii) Other precautions\r\r\nWhen using the 250 ml and 500 ml pack sizes, use only automatic syringe equipment.

Each mL of this ready-to-use sterile suspension contains ceftiofur hydrochlo-ride equivalent to:\r\r\n- Ceftiofur 50 mg \r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacology:\r\r\nCeftiofur is a beta-lactam antibiotic from the cephalosporin class. Beta lactams exert their inhibitory effect by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. This interference is primarily due to its covalent binding to the penicillin-binding proteins, which are essential for synthesis of the bacterial wall. Ceftiofur administered as either ceftiofur sodium (NAXCEL ® Sterile Powder) or ceftiofur crystalline free acid (EXCEDE Sterile Suspension) is rapidly metabolized to desfuroylceftiofur, the primary metabolite with antimicrobial activity. Two intramuscular injections of EXCEDE Sterile Suspension at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg body weight in the horse provide concentrations of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur related metabolites in plasma above the therapeutic target of 0.2 μg/mL for the entire 96 hour (4 day) dosing interval and for 6 days after the second injection (or a total of 10 days from the beginning of treatment)\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n•  Bovine respiratory disease (BRD, shipping fever, pneumonia) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella\r\r\nmultocida and Histophilus somni.\r\r\n•  Acute bovine interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot, pododermatitis) associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus.\r\r\n•  Acute metritis (0 to 14 days post-partum) associated with bacterial organisms susceptible to ceftiofur.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n•  Shake well before using.\r\r\n•  For bovine respiratory disease and acute bovine interdigital necrobacillosis: administer by I/M or S/C 1 - 2 mL  / 45 kg (1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg).\r\r\n- administer daily at 24 hour intervals for a total of 3 consecutive days. Additional treatments may be administered on Days 4 and 5 for animals which do not show a satisfactory response (not recovered) after the initial three treatments.\r\r\n\r\r\n•  For BRD only, administer I/M or S/C 2 mL / 45 kg  (2.2 mg/kg) every other day on Days 1 and 3 (48 hour interval).

As with other NSAIDs, Arabmeglunix injection may potentiate the effects of warfarin and other drugs.\r\r\n- Due to their common mode of action, Flunixin may potentiate and be potentiated by other NSAIDs which acts by interfering with prostaglandin synthesis.\r\r\n- Some NSAIDs may be highly bound to plasma proteins and complete with other highly bound drugs to produce an increase in non bound pharmacologically active concentrations, which can lead to toxic effect.\r\r\n- Use in any animals less than 6 weeks of age or in aged animals may involve additional risk if such use can not be avoided. Animals may require a reduced dosage and careful clinical management.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings\r\r\n- It is preferable that Flunixin Is not administered to animals undergoing general anesthesia until fully recovered.\r\r\n- NSAIDs can cause inhibition of phagocytosis and hence in the treatment of inflammatory conditions associated with bacterial infections, appropriate concurrent anti-microbial therapy should be instigated.\r\r\n- Repeated use in equine colic is not generally recommended due to pain masking effect.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time\r\r\nCattle meat: 8 days of the last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects\r\r\n- Isolated reports of localized swelling, induration, sweating, and stiffness following Flunixin use.\r\r\n- Rarely anaphylactic-like reaction have been reported primarily following Intravenous use.\r\r\n- Prolonged use of NSAIDs, including Flunixin, may predispose gastrointestinal irritation, and in severe cases, ulceration.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\nstore at temperature not exceeding 30°C away from light within 10 days after opening when temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackage\r\r\nCaron box containing dark brown (type III) glass vial containing 30, 50, 100 ml solution with elastic, opaque chlorobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with aluminum cap with outer label and insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nThe Arab company for gelatin & Pharmaceutical products (ARAB-CAPS)\r\r\n\r\r\nDistributed by Eluvet-trading",

Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride-ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites.\r\r\n- Clorsulon inhibits glycolytic enzymes of Fasciola hepatica. This enzymatic inhibition effectively blocks the Embden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway and thereby deprives the fluke of its main source of metabolic energy.\r\r\n- When clorsulon and ivermectin were delivered at 200 µg/kg ivermectin and 2 mg/kg clorsulon, the combination of active substances was efficacious against Fasciola hepatica. It was concluded that for this application, there are no adverse interactions between the two active substances.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndication:\r\r\n• For the treatment of mixed trematode and nematode or arthropod infestations, due to adult and immature roundworms, lungworms, warbles, mites, lice and liver fluke in cattle.\r\r\n- Gastro-intestinal roundworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited larval stages) O. lyrata, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia pectinata, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult), Nematodirus helvetianus (adul), Nematodirus spathiger (adult).\r\r\n- Lungworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparous.\r\r\n- Liver fluke (adult): Fasciola hepatica.\r\r\n- Warbles (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum.\r\r\n- Mange Mites: Psoroptes bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis.\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cattle\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- the product should be given once by subcutaneous injection\r\r\n- Active ingredient: The recommended dosage is 200 mcg of ivermectin and 2 mg of clorsulon per kilogram\r\r\n- Whole product: 1 ml per 50 kg of bodyweight\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\n- Do not use in non-lactating dairy cows including pregnant heifers within 60 days of calving.\r\r\n- Not for use in species other than cattle as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities, may occur in dogs for example.\r\r\n- Do not use by the intravenous or intramuscular route.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals known to be hypersensitive to the active substance.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarning and precautions:\r\r\n- Divide doses greater than 10 ml between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects:\r\r\nTransitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration.

T max in cattle, goats, horses, pigs, dogs and cats is reached within 30 minutes after intramuscular administration. The T% (half-life time) varies depending on the species between 5 and 20 hours. The bioavailability after intramuscular administration is approximately 100%.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic\r\r\nDexamethasone is a potent synthetic with low mineralocorticoid activity. Dexamethas one has ten to twenty times the anti-inflammatory activity of prednisolone at an equivalent molar dose. Corticosteroids may decrease the immune response. Indeed, they inhibit capillary dilation, leukocyte migration and phagocytosis. Glucocorticoids have an effect on metabolism by increasing gluconeogenesis.

Then this agent is bacteriostatic. Also Oxytetracyclines alter the permeability of the cell wall of the bacteria through the attachment to 50s ribosomal subunit. In this way the antibacterial effect of product is augmented more. On the other hand it reduces transformation of glutamate to cellular proteins resulting in growth inhibition.\r\r\n- Flunixin(as Meglumine), like other NSAIDs inhibits cyclooxygnase enzymes and though prevents prostaglandins and thromboxane synthesis leads to reduction of pain, fever and inflammation\r\r\n\r\r\nIndication:\r\r\n- Treatment of respiratory infections specially caused by pasteurella spp. with severs inflammation and for the control of associated pyrexia in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle.\r\r\n- Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and certain mycoplasmas in vitro which are sensitive to oxytetracycline.\r\r\n- Treatment of acute mastitis with edema.\r\r\n- Treatment of gastrointestinal infections.\r\r\n- Treatment of metritis with fever and pain.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- 1 ml / 10 kg initially by intravenous then by intramuscular injection daily up to 5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarning and Precautions:\r\r\n- IV injection should be done slowly.\r\r\n- Do not mix with c a ++ preparations.\r\r\n- Do not administer more than 10 ml in one site of injection.\r\r\n- Should not be given in cattle producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n- In animals suffering from cardiac, or renal disease. Where there is a possibility of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding\r\r\n- Do not administer other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concurrently or within 24 hours of each other.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals showing hypersensitivity to either flunixin meglumine or oxytetracycline.",

They act by competing with tissue factors, notably p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and are therefore inactive in the presence of necrotic tissue.\r\r\n- They ar bacteriostatic to a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are active against aerobic Gram-positive cocci and some rods many Gram-negative rods including Enterobacteriaceae. Sulphonamides are also active against Chlamydophila, Toxoplasma, and coccidia.\r\r\n- The popularity of Sulphadimidine results from the relatively slow excretion (the half life of elimination in the food producing animals is 8-12 h) and also from the good solubility of both the parent drug and metabolites which reduces the possibility crystaluria. About 70% Of the drug is protein bound.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nSulphadimidine has been shown to be effective in vitro against the following bacterial species: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Salmonella typhimurium and Actinobacillus lignieresi.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecific indications:\r\r\nenteritis caused by Escherichia coli, Salmonella dublin and Salmonella typhimurium: salmonellosis and septicaema caused by Salmonella dublin and Salmonella typhimurum pasteurellosis and infections of the respiratory tract caused by Pasteurella haemolytica, atrophic rhinitis caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella haemolytica; and wooden tongue caused by Actinobacillus lignieresi.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle, sheep and pigs.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\nCattle, sheep, and pigs: by subcutaneous or intravenous (preferred) injection: 65 ml/100 kg daily on day 1 (initial dose), then 32 ml/100 kg daily for 5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-indications:\r\r\nSulphonamide hypersensitivity; severe hepatic impairment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide-effects:\r\r\nAgranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia, avitaminosis-K with prolonged administration; crystalluria.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\nCare in renal impaiment, ensure adequate water intake during treatment; avoid prolonged administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period:\r\r\n- Cattle and Sheep meat: 18 days\r\r\n- Cattle milk: 6.5 days\r\r\n- Pigs meat: 42 days\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition:\r\r\n- Store at a temperature not exceeding 30°C away from light & keep out of reach of children.\r\r\n- Shelf-life: 3 years.\r\r\n- Shelf-life after opening: 3 months.\r\r\n\r\r\nPacking:\r\r\nCarton box containing amber glass (type II) vial of 100 ml, 250 ml or 500 ml solution with rubber stopper and aluminum cap + insert leaflet",

It's active against all stages of every major parasitic nematode. It is also a potent ectoparasiticide. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Clorsulon is antiparasitic, approved for use in the treatment of immature and adult forms of Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke) in cattle. Clorsulon inhibits the glycolytic enzymes 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase, thereby blocking the Emden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway: The fluke is deprived of its main metabolic energy source and dies.\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Nitroxynil is a member of Substituted Phenols chemical group and is a fasciolicide which is only active by injection. It's active against adult fluke, with some activity against fly larvae (e.g. Cestrusovis) and blood sucking nematodes The mechanism of action is thought to be due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cattle\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nAdult and Immature stages of:\r\r\n- Small brown stomach worm ( including third and fourth stage lanvae and inhibited immatures) caused by Ostertagia ostertagia\r\r\n- Barber's pole worm caused by Haemonchus placei\r\r\n- Stomach hair worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Trichostrongylus axei\r\r\n- Small intestinal worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Cooperia spp\r\r\n- Hookworm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Bunostomum phlebotomum\r\r\n- Nodule worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Oesophagostomum radiatum\r\r\n\r\r\nAdult stages of:\r\r\n- Whipworm caused by Trichuris spp\r\r\n- Thin necked intestinal worm caused by Nematodirus spp\r\r\n- Intestinal worm caused by Strongyloides papillosus\r\r\n\r\r\nOther internal parasites:\r\r\n- Liver Fluke(early immature (including 2-week old), immat u caused by Fasciola hepatica\r\r\n- Lungworm (adult and immature including inhibited stages) DIctyocaulus viviparous\r\r\n- Eyeworm (aduit) caused by Thelazia spp\r\r\n\r\r\nExternal parasites:\r\r\n- Sucking Lice caused by Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus\r\r\n- Cattle tick caused by Boophilus microplus\r\r\n\r\r\nAids in the control of:\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis\r\r\n- Biting lice: Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administation:\r\r\n- Route: by Subcutaneous injection\r\r\n- For whole product: 1.5 ml / 50 kg body weight\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautionss:\r\r\n• If product leaks from the injection site, Staining of the coat of light coloured cattle may occur for a period of several weeks.

Procaine can be converted to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which is a precursor of nucleic acid formation in bacteria. This can interfere with the action inhibitor of nucleic acid synthesis exhibited by sulfonamides.\r\r\n- DIHYDROSTREPTOMYCIN: Aminoglycosides may also interact with some diuretics that act on the loop of Henle, such as furosemide or acid anachronistic, causing an increase in nephrotoxicity. They are incompatible with heparin, hydrocortisone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDose and route of administration\r\r\n- by intramuscular route injection.\r\r\n- Cattle, pigs, sheep and horses: 0.5- 1 ml / 10 Kg of live weight; each day during 3-4 days.\r\r\n- Dogs and cats: 2-3 ml/ 10 Kg of live weight, every day for 3-4 days.\r\r\n- Once the suspension is done, it maintains its activity for 2-3 days if it is kept in cool site.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\n- Acute anaphylaxis and collapse although reactions are more common milder hypersensitivity (urticaria, fever, angioneurotic edema).\r\r\n- In case of poisoning due to overdose, it is recommended to immediately discontinue the treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\n- Meat: 30 days.\r\r\n- Do not administer the product in horses intended for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic\r\r\n- PENICILLINS: Penicillins disrupt the development of bacterial cell walls by interfering with with the transpeptidase enzymes responsible for the formation of the conjugates between peptidoglycan filaments. Normal bacterial growth depends on balance between cell wall deposition and autolysis. When a penicillin reacts inhibits synthetic enzymes, a defective cell wall is formed causing abnormal cell elongation, spheroplast formation, and osmotic lysis.\r\r\n- DIHYDROESTREPTOMYCIN SULFATE: Inhibition of protein synthesis by aminoglycosides is based on binding, much stronger than with any other inhibitor of protein synthesis, to the subunit 30 S of the bacterial ribosome. The specific point of attachment varies slightly depending on the specific antibiotic, but in general it has as a consequence the erroneous reading of the genetic message, by interfering with the correct pairing of the bases of the codon of the tRNA. This causes the beginning of the synthesis to be blocked by preventing the placement of the first amino acid, formylmethionine, or that translation is interrupted prematurely originating a non-functional truncated protein, or that they are placed amino acids other than those specified by the base sequence of the mRNA, forming abnormal proteins. The destruction of the microorganism is all the more faster the higher the concentration of the antibiotic. The lethal effect on cells bacterial seems to be related to the formation of abnormal channels in the cell membranes caused by the synthesis of abnormal membrane proteins. The Transport of aminoglycosides into cells occurs in part by a process of oxygen-dependent active transport, a mechanism that is not present in anaerobic microorganisms, which explains why their action is limited to bacteria aerobic. This transport is favored by the presence of antibiotics that block the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, such as B-lactams, which act therefore as synergistic agents of aminoglycosides.\r\r\n- Trypsin: Trypsin is a peptidase enzyme, which breaks protein bonds by hydrolysis to form peptides or smaller amino acids. trypsin is produced in the pancreas and secreted into the duodenum (part of the intestine), where it is essential for digestion. The optimum pH is 8 and the optimum temperature is 37°C. Is a specific enzyme as it binds to the peptide at the carboxyl terminal positions where there is Arginine (Arg) or Lysine (Lys), both amino acids with charged R groups positively, fragmenting the initial peptide. Trypsin is produced by the pancreas in the form of trypsinogen (inactive enzyme), and then it is activated in the duodenum by intestinal enterokinase to trypsin (enzyme active) by proteolytic cleavage.\r\r\n- CHYMOTRYPSIN: Chymotrypsin is added to reduce swelling of the mammary gland tissue and oedema. This facilitates the diffusion of the antibiotic by dissolving barriers such as blood clot, pus and tissue shrinkage.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETICS\r\r\n- PENICILLINS G: They are bactericidal antibiotics. destroy the bacterial cell wall they bind to a variety of proteins, responsible for the synthesis of said wall. The interference with such proteins results in death and lysis of the bacteria. The union is occurs with specific targets on the inner surface of the cell membrane bacteria, PBPs, enzymes (transpeptidases, carboxypeptidases and endopeptidases) involved in terminal stages of bacterial wall assembly and in the modification of the aforementioned wall during cell division. As a result of binding, the enzymes are inactivated. Different beta lactams have an affinity for different PBPs, with different results, according to the activity of the specific PBP. Inactivation can cause direct cell death, inhibition of glucose synthesis amino glycans with lysis or activation of autolytic enzymes Bacterial death is, then, the product of an indirect mechanism of inactivation enzymatic Penetration, essential for binding to PBPs, is more easily achieved in gram-positive bacteria than in gram-negative ones, due to the presence of lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins that coat the bacterial cell wall of these latest. The rate of absorption and excretion depends on the salt used, with salts being sodium and potassium salts of rapid absorption and excretion while the procaine and benzathine are slowly absorbed and remain in the body for a long time\r\r\n- DIHYDROESTREPTOMYCIN SULFATE: Following intramuscular administration, rapid absorption occurs from the inoculation, reaching the highest concentrations in blood after one hour.

        "description": "Composition\r\r\nEach ml contains:\r\r\nActive substance:\r\r\n- Ampicillin (as anhydrous ampicillin) 100 mg\r\r\n\r\r\nExcipients\r\r\n- Dodecyl gallate (as antioxidant preservative)  87.5 mcg\r\r\n- Aluminium monostearate\r\r\n- Fractionated coconut oil.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmaceutical form\r\r\nSuspension for injection. White to off white suspension\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamic properties\r\r\n- Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic which has bactericidal activity against mainly Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative aerobes. It is sensitive to beta-lactamase (penicillinase) inactivation. It is widely distributed in the extracellular fluids after absorption, and eliminated almost entirely by the kidneys.\r\r\n- Bioavailability studies indicate that a minimum duration of activity of 48 hours can be expected following a single injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic properties\r\r\n- Amfipen LA, containing ampicillin anhydrate in a long acting base, has been especially developed to overcome the disadvantage of frequent administrations required for short-acting ampicillin formulations. Blood level studies clearly show that the injection interval can be extended to at least 48 hours instead of the usual 12-24 hours.\r\r\n- After an initial peak at one hour after injection, the ampicillin concentrations decline slowly and gradually over the 48 hour period and 34 to 50 % of the ampicillin becomes available on the second day after injection.\r\r\n- Animal studies have demonstrated that ampicillin is evenly distributed throughout the body tissues and is concentrated in the liver and the kidneys. It is excreted unchanged in the urine. Investigations have shown that ampicillin is excreted in high concentration in the bile.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species\r\r\nCattle, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications for use\r\r\nAmfipen LA is indicated for treatment of diseases or secondary infections due to the following bacteria sensitive to ampicillin in dogs, cats, cattle, sheep and pigs and where prolongation of activity from a single injection is required: Streptococcus spp., Trueperella pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus species.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\n- Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients.\r\r\n- Do not administer to rabbits, hamsters or guinea pigs. Not effective against beta-lactamase producing organisms.\r\r\n- Do not use this product in horses due to the likelihood of severe local reaction at the injection site.\r\r\n- Do not inject dogs and cats intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects\r\r\nSevere disturbances of the intestinal bacterial flora of herbivores may occur.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for use\r\r\n- Whenever possible, the product should only be used based on susceptibility testing.\r\r\n- Official and local antimicrobial policies should be taken into account when the product is used.\r\r\n- Use of the product deviating from the instructions given in the SPC may increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to ampicillin and may decrease the effectiveness of treatment with other beta-lactams due to the potential for cross-resistance.\r\r\n\r\r\nOperator warnings\r\r\n- Penicillin and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact. Hypersensitivity to penicillin may lead to cross reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.\r\r\n1. Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.\r\r\n2. Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions.\r\r\n3. If you develop symptoms following exposure, such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning. Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid accidental self-injection. In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions\r\r\n- Severe disturbances of the intestinal bacterial flora of herbivores may occur.\r\r\nAllergies to ampicillin can occur rarely. Local swelling at the injection site may occur in dogs, this usually regresses spontaneously in 2-4 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy or Lactation\r\r\nNo special precautions necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions\r\r\n- Bacteria, particularly gram-negative organisms, that show a cross-resistance with other ß lactam antibiotics may show resistance.\r\r\n- There is antagonism between this product and antibiotics with bacteriostatic activity.\r\r\nAmounts to be administered and administration route\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n• Cattle and sheep 15 mg/kg, pigs 25 mg/kg by intramuscular route.\r\r\n• Dogs 15 mg/kg, cats 20 mg/kg by subcutaneous route.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n- Clean the area of the injection site and swab with spirit.\r\r\n- This product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\r\r\n- Only dry sterile needles and syringes should be used for administration and the septum should be swabbed before removing each dose.\r\r\n- Do not use the same injection site more than once during a course of treatment.\r\r\n- Do not administer more than 10 ml per injection site in pigs and sheep and 20 ml in cattle.\r\r\n- Treatment may be repeated once after 48 hours.\r\r\n- To ensure a correct dosage, body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid under dosing.\r\r\n- Do not mix with any other veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nAmpicillin is a compound with a very high therapeutic ratio. It is unlikely that an overdose of Amfipen LA will have adverse effects on the treated animal. No specific antidote or treatment is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal periods\r\r\nNot to be used in animals producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\nAnimals must not be slaughtered for human consumption during treatment.\r\r\nCattle, sheep and pigs may be slaughtered for human consumption only after 60 days from the last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for storage\r\r\nDo not store above 25 °C.

Both the active ingredients potentiate the effect of each other.\r\r\n- Vitamin E prevents the formation of bonds between lipoperoxides and unsaturated fatty acids (an important component of cell walls), thus protecting cell membranes from destruction. Originating tocopherol radicals may be reduced by ascorbic acid. Selenium is needed in cells for the formation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), which acts as an antioxidant in the cell fluid; hydroperoxides and lipoperoxides are converted with glutathione to harmless reduced forms. With this effect selenium supplements the protective effect of vitamin E.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nHorses.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nIt is used in the prevention of the following clinical signs when associated with Myositis (STD) syndrome, rapid respiration, profuse sweating, muscle spasms and stiffness.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Route of administration: Slow Intravenous or deep intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- For Whole product: 1 ml / 45 kg B.wt, may be repeated at 5-10 days intervals.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautions:\r\r\n- Intravenous administration should be by slow injection.\r\r\n- Do not exceed the recommended dose.\r\r\n- Selenium is toxic if administered in excess.\r\r\n- Don’t use products containing benzyl alcohol for newly born pets/ domestic animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n- Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients.\r\r\n- Do not use at the same time as any other selenised fertilizer, prill or product without consulting a veterinarian.\r\r\n- Do not exceed stated dose volume and frequency.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide effects:\r\r\nPossibility of Anaphylactic shocks, signs include excitement, sweating, trembling, ataxia, respiratory distress, and cardiac dysfunction.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- Meat: Nil\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\n- Store at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n- Used after opening for 1 month when stored at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nCarton box containing an amber type II glass vial of 100 ml solution, closed with bromobutyl rubber, and crimped with flip-off aluminum cap.

Triclabendazole also inhibits protein synthesis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetic particulars\r\r\n- Triclabendazole is readily absorbed and oxidised to its sulfoxide and sulfone. Triclabendazole sulfoxide reaches peak concentrations approximately 1 day after administration of FASINEX and the sulfone reaches peak concentrations approximately 3 days after administration. Both metabolites bind strongly to plasma protein, particularly albumin.\r\r\n- Metabolites are excreted via the bile, primarily as conjugates. More than 90% of the total dose of FASINEX is excreted in the faeces, about 5% in the urine and 1% in milk. Elimination is virtually complete by 10 days after administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications for use, specifying the target species\r\r\nFor the treatment of acute, subacute and chronic infection due to early immature, immature, and mature stages of Fasciola hepatica. If infected animals are treated before disease has developed, fasciolosis can be prevented.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications: None known\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & administration\r\r\n- To ensure administration of a correct dose, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible; accuracy of the dosing device should be checked. If animals are to be treated collectively rather than individually they should be grouped according to their bodyweight and dosed accordingly, in order to avoid under- or over-dosing.\r\r\n- Administer 5 mL/100 kg body weight, equivalent to 12 mg triclabendazole per kg of body weight. FASINEX 240 is administered orally after thorough shaking of the suspension. Most types of automatic drenching guns are suitable. Clean drenching gun before and after use. FASINEX can safely be given to young, pregnant or stressed cattle, cattle not producing milk intended for human consumption or dry cattle.\r\r\n- Fasinex 240 is given once. The administration may be repeated several weeks or months after the first treatment depending on the epidemiological situation. In case of acute fasciolosis, treat immediately, then repeat in approximately 4-6 weeks, and consult a veterinarian for advice.\r\r\n\t\r\r\n- Up to 50 kg: 2.5 ml\r\r\n- >50-70: 3.5 ml\r\r\n- >70-100: 5 ml\r\r\n- >100-150: 7.5 ml\r\r\n- >150-200: 10 ml\r\r\n- >200-300: 15 ml\r\r\n- >300-400: 20 ml\r\r\n- >400-500: 25 ml\r\r\n\r\r\n- Add 5 mL for each additional 100 kg\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy.\r\r\n• Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n• Underdosing, which may be due to underestimation of bodyweight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device (if any).\r\r\n- Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the test(s) strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, and anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n- Resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in Fasciola hepatica in a number of countries including ones in the EU. Therefore the use of this product should be based on local epidemiological information about susceptibility of F. hepatica and recommendations on how to limit further selection for resistance to anthelmintics. Dosing programmes should be discussed with your Veterinary Adviser.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial precautions for use\r\r\n(i) Special precautions for use in animals: None known\r\r\n\r\r\n(ii) Special precautions for the person\r\r\n- Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling the product. Wash hands and exposed skin after handling the product.\r\r\n- In case of accidental spillage onto skin or in eyes, wash immediately with water. Take off any contaminated clothes.\r\r\n(iii) Other precautions: None known\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions (frequency and seriousness): None known\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy or lactation\r\r\nFASINEX is neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic, and can be used in all stages of pregnancy. Concerning use during lactation refer to Withdrawal period section below.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteraction: None known\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nA single oral dose of 150-200 mg triclabendazole/kg of body weight was shown to lead to side effects such as stumbling gait, depression, and decreased appetite. These side effects are slight and last 1 to 3 days. An antidote is not known.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 52 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Milk for human consumption may only be taken from 48 hours after calving. Not intended for use within 48 days of calving. Should a cow calve earlier than 48 days after the last treatment, milk for human consumption may only be taken from 50 days after the last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nIncompatibilities: None Known\r\r\n\r\r\nShelf life\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years\r\r\n- After first opening: 12 months\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage precautions \r\r\n- Store in tightly closed original container.\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\n- High density polyethylene bottles of 0.8, 2.2, 5 and 12 litres\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.",

Typically, such swelling resolves within 14 days. Slight, transient increases in temperature (up to 1.2°C) may be observed within 24 hours of vaccination, resolving within 4 days after vaccination. If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle (pregnant cows and heifers)\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nDirection for use:\r\r\n- For intramuscular use. One dose: 3 ml\r\r\n- One injection in the course of each pregnancy between the week 12 – 3 before calving is expected.\r\r\n\r\r\nFeeding of colostrum\r\r\n- The protection of calves depends on adequate ingestion of colostrum from vaccinated cows. Measures should be taken to ensure that calves receive sufficient amounts of colostrum within the first few days of life. It is important that all calves receive sufficient amounts of colostrum within the first six hours after calving. The highest content of antibodies in the colostrum is reached 72 hours after parturition, however absorption of antibodies in the gut of calves is highest within the first 6 – 8 hours after parturition. In the dairy herd, it is recommended that colostrum/milk from the first 6 – 8 milkings of vaccinated mothers is collected and pooled. During the first two weeks of life, the calves must be fed with 2,5 – 3 liters of this pooled colostrum/milk per day.\r\r\n- To achieve optimum results and to reduce infection pressure on the farm, a whole herd cow vaccination policy should be adopted and all newborn calves should be fed with the pooled colostrum.\r\r\n \r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Common aseptic procedures should be used during vaccination.\r\r\n- Only sterile syringes and needles should be used.\r\r\n- Allow the vaccine to reach room temperature before use.\r\r\n- Shake well before and occasionally during use to ensure that the sediment is dissolved prior to administration.\r\r\n- Do not mix with any other veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nZero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.\r\r\n- Store and transport refrigerated (2 - 8°C), in the dark place.\r\r\n- Protect from frost.\r\r\n- Once broached use within 10 hours or discard.\r\r\n- Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n» To the person:\r\r\n- This product contains mineral oil.

The product can be applied to small and large animals, being an effective option in the treatment of various contaminations.\r\r\n• Mercepton's formula acts in defense of the organism of cattle, goats, pigs and even domestic animals such as dogs and cats. Its use is therefore indicated for various situations such as:\r\r\n- Drug poisoning caused due to excessive consumption of sulfa vermifuge and other antibiotics as well as any other prolonged treatment that causes digestive disorders as a side effect. Mercepton favors the methylation of different chemical substances, facilitating their elimination from the body.\r\r\n- Poisoning resulting from the accidental ingestion of household and industrial cleaning products or incorrect dilutions of lethal chemical substances such as liquid waxes, kerosene, insecticides and rodenticides. Here Mercepton is used as a supportive treatment in the animal's recovery.\r\r\n- Treatment and prevention of B-complex hypovitaminosis, liver cell degeneration and fatty infiltration. As a lipotropic agent Mercepton promotes the conversion of liver fat into phospholipids that can be transferred more rapidly from the liver into the blood. In this way, the drug prevents liver steatosis (fatty degeneration).\r\r\n• Mercepton can also be used as an immunostimulant during periods of vaccination, aiding in the formation of antibodies. In addition, the product is effective in treating cases of ingestion of toxic plants and spoiled food.\r\r\n• Available in two versions Mercepton Injectable and Mercepton Oral, the option guarantees the recovery of animals in order to ensure their health and well-being, avoiding losses for owners and breeders.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- MERCEPTON is the association of 3 notable lipotropic and antitoxic agents for stimulating the body's defenses against hepatotoxic agents aided by glucose with its dynamogenic and also protective action of the parenchyma against harmful agents and B-Complex vitamins that at the same time increase the mechanism natural protector stimulate the transmethylating power of the liver.\r\r\n- As a hepatoprotector before or after treatments with endoparasiticidal or ectoparasiticidal endectocides, thus favoring the methylation of different chemical substances, facilitating their elimination from the body.\r\r\n- As an immunostimulant during vaccination periods, aiding in the formation of antibodies.\r\r\n- As a supportive treatment in the recovery of the animal in accidents caused by accidental ingestion or even incorrect dilutions of lethal chemical substances (insecticides, rodenticides, toxic plants, spoiled food).\r\r\n- As a lipotropic agent promoting the conversion of hepatic fat into phospholipids which can be transferred more quickly from the liver to the blood, thus avoiding hepatic steatosis (fatty degeneration).\r\r\n \r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- Large animals (cattle and horses) from 20 to 100 mL / day;\r\r\n- Medium-sized animals (foals, calves, goats, sheep and pigs) from 10 to 30 mL / day;\r\r\n- Small animals (dogs, piglets) from 2 to 10 mL / day.\r\r\n- The duration of treatment is at the discretion of the Veterinarian.\r\r\n \r\r\nManagement:\r\r\nIntramuscular or intravenous injections.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\n- Disinfect the application site.\r\r\n- Use disposable or sterilized syringes and needles.\r\r\n \r\r\nPresentation:\r\r\n20 and 100 mL vial.",

        "description": "Synthetic prostaglandin hormone\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\r\n- D-Cloprostenol (sodium)  75 mcg\r\r\n- Excipient: Chlorocresol  1 mg\r\r\n- Other excipients s.q.f.  1 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMICS\r\r\n- LUTEOSYL is a speciality based on a dextrorotatory cloprostenol which is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin F2a. The dextrorotatory enantiomer is the biologically active luteolytic component of cloprostenol.\r\r\n- LUTEOSYL is approximately 3.5 times more potent than similar specialities based on racemic cloprostenol. Therefore it can be used proportionally at a lower dose. LUTEOSYL is more efficacious and better tolerated than racemic cloprostenol.\r\r\n- During the luteinizing stage of the oestrus cycle LUTEOSYL induces a decrease in the number of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors in the ovary, awhich leads to a rapid regression of the corpus luteum and a decrease in progesterone levels. The anterior part of the pituitary gland increases the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). This allows a new follicle to mature, oestrus to appear and ovulation.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETICS\r\r\n- The assays carried out in rats indicate that d-cloprostenol is more widely distributed a and more rapidly eliminated than racemic cloprostenol.\r\r\n- D-cloprostenol reaches a maximum value 5 minutes after intramuscular administration in rats. These values decrease to a level close to zero after approximately 12 h.\r\r\n- The maximum concentration is observed in the liver after 10-20 minutes. A decrease to values close to 1 x 10⁴ bmp/g is observed after 60-90 minutes. The elimination half-life is 5.7 hours for d-cloprostenol (less than that for racemic cloprostenol - which is 9.4 hours).\r\r\n- The highest concentration in kidney is obtained after 5 minutes, followed by a reduction to extremely low values 45 minutes after administration. The concentration increases to maximum levels in the ovaries after 5-6 hours. Compared with racemic cloprostenol, the concentration of d-cloprostenol in ovary is 4-5 times higher in the first 20 minutes after administration.\r\r\n- In the uterus the quantity of d-cloprostenol is 2-5 times that of racemic cloprostenol.\r\r\n- The maximum concentration in muscle at the administration site is obtained in the first 5 minutes. The same concentration is obtained in other muscles in the same time. A rapid fall is observed after 45-60 minutes.\r\r\n- A second peak is observed in the inoculation muscle after 2-6 hours.\r\r\n- In cattle the maximum concentration of d-cloprostenol appears 1.5 hours after administration (1337.9 ± 123.75 pg/ml). A fall is observed from 1.5 hours post-administration. Low levels persist for 24 hours. The elimination constant is Ke = 0.428 hours. The biological half-life is 1 h 37 minutes.\r\r\n- Bioavailability, calculated in accordance with the AUC, is 11404.23 pg/h/ml. \r\r\n- In swine the maximum plasma concentration is reached 10 minutes - 1.3 hours after administration, followed by a decrease to initial values after 5.17 ± 0.33 hours. The elimination half-life is 3.2 ± 0.39 hours. The elimination constant is 0.222 ± 0.03 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCows and sows.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n• Cows:\r\r\n» Indication for reproduction: synchronization or induction of oestrus. Induction to parturition.\r\r\n» Therapeutics indications: ovarian dysfunction (persistent corpus luteum, luteal cyst), interruption of gestation including foetal mummification, endometritis/pyometra, delayed uterine involution.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Sows:\r\r\n» Indications for reproduction: Induction of parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nDo not use in gestating animals unless it is desirable to induce parturition or therapeutic interruption of pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- In safety studies, at 10 times the therapeutic dose, no adverse reactions are reported. As no specific antidote has been identified, in the case of overdose, symptomatic therapy is advisable.\r\r\n- If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet,please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nCows:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 1 day\r\r\n- Milk: 0 hours\r\r\n\r\r\nSows:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 1 day\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- LUTEOSYL is only administered by intramuscular route.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cows: The recommended dose is 2 ml per animal.\r\r\n- Oestrus induction (also in cows with weak or silent heat): Administer the product after the presence of corpus luteum has been determined (6th-8th day of the cycle). Heat is normally observed after 48-60 hours. Inseminate 72-96 hours after the previous treatment. If heat is not observed, repeat after 11 days.\r\r\n- Parturition Induction: Administer the product after the 270th day of gestation. Parturition should occur 30-60 hours after treatment.\r\r\n- Oestrus synchronization: Administer the product twice (11 days apart). Inseminate artificially 72 and 96 hours after the second injection.\r\r\n- Ovarian dysfunction: After the presence of corpus luteum has been determined, administer the product and inseminate during the first heat after treatment. If no heat is observed, carry out another gynaecological examination and repeat the injection 11 days after the first treatment.\r\r\n- Endometritis or pyometra: Administer 1 dose of product. Repeat treatment 10 days later if necessary. Inseminate 72-96 hours after treatment.\r\r\n- Gestation interruption: Administer the product in the first 150 days of gestation.\r\r\n- Foetal mummification: Administer 1 dose of product. The foetus is expelled 3 or 4 days later.\r\r\n- Retarded uterine involution: Administer 1 dose of product and, if indicated repeat treatment once or twice at 24 hour interval.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sows: The recommended dose is 1 ml per animal.\r\r\n- Parturition induction: Administer the product from the 112th day of gestation. Repeat after 6 hours. Alternatively, 20 hours after the initial dose of d-cloprostenol, a myometrial stimulant (oxytocin or carazolol) may be administered. Following the protocol of double administration, in about 70% of cases, parturition occurs 19-30 hours after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nAs with parenteral administration of any substance, basic antiseptic rules should be observed. The injection site must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected in order to reduce the risk of infection with anaerobic bacteria. Occurrence of anaerobic infections is likely if anaerobic bacteria penetrate the tissue of the injection site. This applies especially to intramuscular injection and in particular to cows. Typical local reactions due to anaerobic infection are swelling and crepitus at the injection site.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Shelf life: 2 years.\r\r\n- Store in temperature not exceed 30°C and keep away from light.\r\r\n- Shelf life after opening: 28 days and store in temperature not exceed 25°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\nTo the animals\r\r\n- Do not use in gestating animals unless it is desirable to induce parturition or therapeutic interruption of pregnancy.\r\r\n- Do not use in animals being treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, as the synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins is inhibited.\r\r\n- The activity of other oxytocic agents can be increased after the administration of Cloprostenol.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo the person\r\r\n- D-cloprostenol like all F2a prostaglandins can be absorbed through the skin and can produce bronchospasm and abortion.\r\r\n- Women of child-bearing age, asthmatics and persons with bronchial problems or any other type of respiratory problem must avoid any contact or use disposable plastic gloves when administering the product.\r\r\n- The product must be handled carefully to avoid accidental self-injection or skin contact.\r\r\n- Do not eat, drink or smoke while handling the product.\r\r\n- In case of accidental self-injection seek medical advice and show the label to the physician.\r\r\n- Seek medical advice immediately in case of any respiratory difficulty caused by accidental inhalation or inoculation.\r\r\n- In case of accidental skin contact, wash with soap and water immediately.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal product should be disposed in accordance with local requirements.

        "description": "Composition:\r\r\nEach 100 ml contains\r\r\n- Ivermectin 1 gm\r\r\n\r\r\nProperities\r\r\n- Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum endectocide of the avermectin family. Ivermectin is isolated after purification and hydrogenation of the avermectin-family compounds which are obtained from the fermentation of the soil organism streptomyces avermitilis. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic-lactone derivative which has a broad and potent antiparasitic activity against nematodes and arthropods. It acts by inhibiting nerve impulses. Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate gated chloride ion channels which ocour in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites.\r\r\n- Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels,. such as those gated by the neurotransmiuer gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is atributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels.\r\r\n- The macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndication:\r\r\n- Ivectin injectable solution is indicated for the treatment and control of the following species of gastro-intestinal roundworms, lungworms, eyeworms, warbles, mites and lice.\r\r\n- Gastro-intestinal roundworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia Ostertagi ( including inhibited O Ostertagi), Ostertagia lyrata, Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus Colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia pectinata, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult), Nematodirus helvatianus(adult), Nematodirus spathiger (adult), Trichuris spp. (adult)\r\r\n- Lungworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparus\r\r\n- Eyeworms (adult): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n- Warbles (parasitic stages): Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum\r\r\n- Mange mites: Psoroptes bovis, Sarcoptes scabei var. bovis\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus\r\r\n- Ivectin injectable solution may also be used as an aid in the control of the biting louse Damalinia bovis and the mange mite Chorioptes bovis, but Complete elimination may not.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cattle & sheep\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & administration:\r\r\n1 ml per 50 kg (2 mg ivermectin per 10 kg b.w.) by SC injection under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder, and repeat after 3 weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings and precautions:\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in inefective therapy.\r\r\n- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n- Under dosing, which may be due to underestimation of body weight misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device.\r\r\n- Do not smoke, eat or drink whilst handling the product.\r\r\n- Do not used for young pet animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-indications:\r\r\n- Do not use in cattle producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Should not be used for lactating animals.\r\r\n- Do not administer intravenously or intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Do not use in non-lactating cows including pregnant heifers within 60 days of calving.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse effects:\r\r\nAt therapeutic doses, ivermectin has no adverse effect on cattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- Cattle: 49 days\r\r\n- Sheep: 42 days\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition:\r\r\n- Store at temperature not exceeding 30° C, in dry place.\r\r\n- Keep away from reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\n20, 50, 100 ml glass vial with outer label & insert leaflet in carton box.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nBadr pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries For Mam Egypt Pharmaceuticals",

C. novyi (type B), C. septicum, C. tetani, C. sordellii and C. haemolyticum and whole cell culture of C. chauvoei.\r\r\n- Covexin 10 also contains potash alum adjuvant and 0.015% w/v thiomersal as a preservative.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\nThis vaccine contains thiomersal at 0.015% w/v. This material may cause a mild allergy reaction in sensitive individual contact. Avoid skin contact.\r\r\n\r\r\nUSES\r\r\n» For the active immunization of sheep and cattle from 2 weeks of age against diseases caused by Clostridium perfringens type A (enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene), C. perfringens type B (lamb dysentery, enterotoxaemia), C. perfringens type C (enterotoxaemia, struck), C. perfringens type D (enterotoxaemia, pulpy kidney), C. chauvoei (black leg, black quarter, post parturient gangrene), C. novyi type B (black disease, infectious necrotic hepatitis), C. septicum (malignant oedema, braxy), C. tetani (tetanus), C. sordellii (sudden death syndrome), and C. haemolyticum (red water disease).\r\r\n» The clinical significance of these diseases in cattle and sheep has not yet been established in New Zealand.\r\r\n» Full protection develops within 14 days of administration of the second dose. Duration of immunity is approximately 12 months from initial vaccination. Studies show that revaccination every 12 months is adequate to generate and maintain immunity. Where high levels of challenge are anticipated, more frequent booster vaccination may need to be considered.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Dose\r\r\n- Sheep and lambs over 2 weeks of age: 1 mL\r\r\n- Cattle and calves over 2 weeks of age: 2 mL\r\r\n\r\r\n» Vaccination programme\r\r\n- The primary course of immunization consists of two injections, allowing an interval of 4-6 weeks between them. An annual booster vaccination is required at intervals of not more than twelve months following the primary course.\r\r\n- Vaccinations should be completed at least two weeks before maximum immunity is required. This may be either a period of risk or in pregnant animals prior to parturition.\r\r\n- Previously sensitized ewes/cows should be injected 2-6 weeks before parturition is due to commence. This provides passive protection of the lamb/calf, via the colostrum (Note: The degree of protection passed to offspring from the dam will vary depending on the dam's level of immunity and the amount of colostrum absorbed by the lamb/calf. These factors are affected by the overall vaccination programme, time since dam vaccination, offspring's ability to suckle, suckling frequency, and number of offspring being suckled. Therefore within a herd/flock there may be varying time periods of protection.).\r\r\n- In lambs passive protection will last for at least 12 weeks against C. tetani, C. novyi, C. perfringens B, C and D and C. sordellii and for up to two weeks against C. septicum, C. perfringens A and C. chauvoei.\r\r\n- In calves passive protection will last for at least 12 weeks against C. tetani, C. novyi, C. perfringens B, C and D, up to 8 weeks for C. septicum and up to 2 weeks for C. sordellii, C. chauvoei, C. perfringens A and C and C. haemolyticum.\r\r\n- The vaccine may be used in lambs and calves as young as two weeks of age regardless of serum antitoxin levels acquired from maternal transfer.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration\r\r\nBy subcutaneous injection in the loose skin on the side of the neck, observing aseptic precautions. The container must be shaken well before doses are withdrawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR USE\r\r\n» Equipment\r\r\n• Use sharp needles\r\r\n• Change needles frequently (every 12 to 20 sheep)\r\r\n• Needles and vaccinating guns should be sterile before starting. Needles can be sterilized by boiling for 10 minutes and storing in methylated spirits.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Assembly of VAXIPAK and draw-off set\r\r\n1. Attach end of draw-off tube to the vaccinating gun.\r\r\n2. Pierce rubber bung of VAXIPAK with draw-off needle, ensuring that plastic overcap snaps into position on the VAXIPAK cap.\r\r\n3. The plastic cord is provided for hanging COVEXIN 10 in a convenient position e.g. from neck, belt, or rail.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Vaccination\r\r\n• Ensure vaccinating gun delivers correct dose.\r\r\n• Vaccinate only clean, dry animals\r\r\n• Inject in the anterior (front) half of the neck.\r\r\n• Inject subcutaneously i.e., between the skin and muscle.\r\r\n• Part the wool, raise the skin to form a 'tent' and insert the needle into the \"tent opening\" so that the needle is almost parallel with the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ETC\r\r\n» Contra-indications\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate unhealthy sheep or cattle, or animals which may be affected by subclinical disease or physiological stress, without the advice of a veterinarian.\r\r\n- No information is available on the safety and efficacy of the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other. It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered within 14 days before or after vaccination with this product.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Warnings\r\r\n- Syringes and needles should be sterilized before use and the injection should be made through an area of clean, dry skin, taking precautions against contamination.\r\r\n- Part-used containers of the vaccine should be discarded at the end of the day's operation, as under field conditions it may be difficult to avoid accidental contamination. Used containers should be disposed of in a landfill or by incineration.\r\r\n- Use of this product may cause transient local reactions to occur at the injection site particularly where careful vaccination technique has not been used.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle\r\r\nSwelling may occur at the site of injection which should resolve within 1-2 months. The incidence and severity may be higher in calves less than one month of age.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Sheep\r\r\nSwelling may occur at the site of injection which should resolve within 1-2 months post vaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Side-effects\r\r\nAs with any vaccine occasional hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In such cases appropriate treatment such as adrenalin or antihistamine should be administered without delay.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD\r\r\n- Milk: Nil\r\r\n- Meat: Nil\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\nStore refrigerated between +2°C and +8°C, protected from light. DO NOT FREEZE. Opened Vaxipaks should be discarded within 8 hours of opening.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE QUANTITIES\r\r\n100 mL and 250 mL flexible packs\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\nShould lambing/calving extend over a period of more than six weeks, the duration of transferred colostral protection in the later horn offspring may be shortened. These lambs/calves should be given their first dose of Covexin 10 from two weeks of age. In any animal population there may be a small number of individuals which fail to respond fully to vaccination. Successful vaccination depends upon correct storage and administration of the vaccine together with the animal's ability to respond. This can be influenced by such factors as genetic constitution, intercurrent infection, age nutritional status, concurrent drug therapy and stress.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured and distributed by:\r\r\nSchering-Plough Animal Health Limited, 33 Whakatiki Street, Upper Hutt, New Zealand.\r\r\n\r\r\nCOVEXIN is a registered trademark of Schering-Plough Animal Health Limited.\r\r\n©Schering-Plough Animal Health Limited 2002.",

        "description": "Synthetic prostaglandin hormone\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION:\r\r\nEach 1 ml contains:\r\r\n- Cloprostenol Sodium 263 µg (eq to 250 µg Cloprostenol base)\r\r\n\r\r\nPROPERITIES:\r\r\n- Cloprostenol, an analogue of prostaglandin F2 alpha, has luteolytic activity. Following the administration of cloprostenol, the plasma level of progesterone drops to a baseline level. Progesterone concentratlons begin to decrease as early as 2 hours after cloprostenol injection. As a result, a female with a functional corpus luteum (at least 5 days) will return to estrus and ovulate 2-5 days after treatment.\r\r\n- Cloprostenol has a mimetic effect of natural prostaglandin F2 alpha on smooth muscle.\r\r\n- After ovulation, there is a refractory pericd of 4-5 days during which the corpus luteum of cattle is insensitive to cloprostenol.\r\r\n- Fertility during induced estrus is of the same order as that observed under natural conditions. No adverse effects were observed on the product designed during the design.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS:\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Induction of luteolysis allowing the triggering of estrus and ovulation in cycled females during use during dioestrus.\r\r\n- Synchronization (over a period of 2 to 5 days) of estrus in groups of cycled females treated simultaneously.\r\r\n- Treatment of subestrus and uterine disorders due to a functional or persistent corpus luteum (endometritis, pyometra).\r\r\n- Treatment of luteinic cysts.\r\r\n- Induction of abortion up to 150 days of gestation.\r\r\n- Elimination of mummified fetuses.\r\r\n- Induction of parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nEquines:\r\r\n- Induction of luteolysis.\r\r\n- Treatment of persistent dioestrus\r\r\n- Treatment of pseudo-gestation.\r\r\n- Treatment of lactation anestrus.\r\r\n- Induction of estrus cycles (sterile mares, fillies).\r\r\n\r\r\nGoats:\r\r\n- Synchronization of estrus.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES:\r\r\nCattle, horses and goats.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Administered by intramuscular route only.\r\r\n\r\r\nIN Cows: 2 mL of solution\r\r\n- Induction and synchronization of estrus, treatment of subestrus: Administer the drug after checking the presence of the corpus luteum, if heat has not been observed following the first injection, it is necessary to perform a second injection 11 days after the first. The animals will be inseminated on observed heat or twice 72 and 96 hours after the second administration.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Interruption of unwanted normal pregnancies: Administer the drug no earlier than 7 days after protrusion and no later than the 150th day of gestation.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Elimination of mummified Fetuses: After administration of the drug, expulsion of the fetus is observed within 3 to 4 days, it may be necessary to manually remove the fetus that would remain stuck in the vagina.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Induction of parturition: administer the drug after the 270th day of gestation, i.e. no earlier than 10 days before the presumed date of calving.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Treatment of chronic endometritis and pyometra: Administer the drug preferably before 60th day postpartum, repeat the treatment 10 to 11 days later if necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Mare:\r\r\n- Light breed: 1 mL of solution intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Heavy breed: 2 mL of solution intramuscularly.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Goats:\r\r\n- 0.4 to 0.8 mL of solution intramuscularly.\r\r\n\r\r\n*The cap should not be punctured more than 4 times.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS:\r\r\nThe product not used in newly born pet animals; as it contains benzyl alcohol.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n(I) Precautions for humans\r\r\n- Direct contact with the skin or mnucous membranes of the operator should be avoided, F2 alpha prostaglandins can be absorbed through the skin and can cause bronchial spasms or abortions. Particular attention should be paid to the handling of the product to avoid any risk of self-injection or contact with the skin.\r\r\n- Pregnant women, women of childbearing age, asthmatics, or people with respiratory diseases should not handle cloprostenol.\r\r\n- In case of accidental sprinkling on the skin, immediately wash the contaminated area with soap and water.\r\r\n- In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or label of the product.\r\r\n\r\r\n(II) Precautions for animals\r\r\nTo reduce the risk of anaerboic infections, potentially related to the pharmacological properties of prostaglandins, avoid injecting through an area of contaminated skin. Thoroughly clean and disinfect injection sites prior to administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION AND LAYING\r\r\n- Do not administer to pregnant females in which induction of abortion or parturition is not desired.\r\r\n- The product can be used safely during lactation.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS:\r\r\n- Do not administer to pregnant females in which induction of abortion or parturition is not desired.\r\r\n- Do not administer to animals with spastic disease of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.\r\r\n\r\r\nDRUG-DRUG INTERACTION:\r\r\nConcomitant use of oxytocin and cloprostenol increases the effects on the uterus.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE EFFECTS:\r\r\n- Anaerobic infection can occur if anaerobic bacteria are penetrated at the injection site, especially following intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- In the context of parturition induction, depending on the date of treatment versus the date of conception, the incidence of placentar retention may be increased.\r\r\n- In very rare cases, anaphylactiC-type reactions can be observed, requiring immediate medical attention.\r\r\n- The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows:\r\r\n-- Very common (side effects in more than 1 animal in 10\r\r\ntreated animals)\r\r\n-- Common (between 1 and 10 animals out of 100 animals\r\r\ntreated)\r\r\n-- Uncommon (between 1 and 10 animals in 1,000 animals\r\r\ntreated)\r\r\n-- Rare (between 1 and 10 animals out of 10,000 animals\r\r\ntreated)\r\r\n-- Very rare (less than one animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated cases).\r\r\n\r\r\nPOISONING:\r\r\n- The therapeutic index in cattle is high. An overdose of more than 10 times the dose is generally well tolerated. A high overdose can cause transient diarrhea. There is no antidote available.\r\r\n- An overdose will not accelerate the regression of the corpus luteum.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL TIME:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 1 day\r\r\n- Milk: zero days\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C, protect from light.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACK:\r\r\nCarton box contains 10 transparent glass ampoules (Type 1) each contains 1 ml or 2 ml injectable solution with outer label and insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nMANUFACTURED BY:\r\r\nMarcyrl Pharmaceutical Industries 2 (MPl)\r\r\nFor Marcyrl Animal Health",

Do not use in cows with clinical mastitis at drying off. See Special warnings.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nNone known. If you notice any side effects, even those not already listed in this package leaflet or you think that the medicine has not worked, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle (dairy cows at drying-off).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nFor intramammary use only. Infuse the content of one syringe of the product into each udder quarter immediately after the last milking of the lactation (at drying off).\r\r\n\r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- The product has a dual tip nozzle. The cap of the syringe can be partially or fully removed. It gives the option to use the syringe with a short tip fora partial insertion technique so that the syringe only needs to be inserted in the teat end.\r\r\n» Step 1: Removal of the breakable cap\r\r\n» Step 2: Long or short tip insertion\r\r\n- It is recommended to use the short tip to allow for partial insertion in order to lower the probability of new infections. DO NOT MASSAGE the teat or udder after infusion of the product. Care must be taken not to introduce pathogens into the teat in order to reduce the risk of post-infusion mastitis. It is essential that the teat is thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, with surgical spirit or alcohol-impregnated wipes. The teats should be wiped until there is no visible dirt collected on the wipe. Teats should be allowed to dry prior to infusion. Infuse aseptically and take care to avoid contamination of the syringe nozzle. Following infusion, it is advisable to use an appropriate teat dip or spray. Under cold conditions the product may be warmed to room temperature in a warm environment, to aid syringeability.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat and offal: Zero days.\r\r\n- Milk: Zero hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.\r\r\n- This veterinary medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions.\r\r\n- Do not use this veterinary medicinal product after the expiry date which is stated on the label.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING(S)\r\r\n» For each target species:\r\r\nSelection of cows for treatment with the product should be based on veterinary clinical judgement. Selection criteria may be based on the mastitis and cell count history of individual cows, or recognized tests for the detection of sub-clinical mastitis or bacteriological sampling.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For use in animals:\r\r\n- It's good practice to observe dry cows regularly for signs of clinical mastitis. If a sealed quarter develops clinical mastitis, the affected quarter should be stripped out manually before appropriate therapy is instituted.\r\r\n- To reduce the risk of contamination, do not immerse the syringe in water. Use the syringe only once. It is important to observe strict aseptic technique for the administration of the product, because the product does not have antimicrobial activity. Do not administer any other intramammary product following administration of the product. In cows that may have sub-clinical mastitis, the product may be used following administration of a suitable dry cow antibiotic treatment to the infected quarter.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the administrator:\r\r\nThis product may cause skin and eye irritation. Avoid contact with skin or eyes. Should skin or eye contact occur, wash the affected area thoroughly with water. If irritation persists, seek medical advice and show this label to the doctor. Bismuth salts have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions. If you know that you are allergic to bismuth salts, avoid using this product. If you develop symptoms following exposure, you should seek medical advice and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician. Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pregnancy:\r\r\n- As the product is not absorbed following intramammary infusion, the product can be used in pregnant animals.\r\r\n- At calving, the seal may be ingested by the calf.

Each ml contains 100 mg xylazine.\r\r\n\r\r\nXylazine Injection is a sedative, analgesic and muscle relaxant for use in horses and Cervidae (Fallow Deer, Mule Deer, Sika Deer, White-Tailed Deer and Elk). Xylazine can be given by intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous routes and by dart gun.\r\r\n\r\r\nXylazine Injection should be used in horses and Cervidae when it is desirable to produce a state of sedation accompanied by a shorter period of analgesia.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Use in Horses and Cervidae (Fallow Deer, Mule Deer, Sika Deer, White-Tailed Deer and Elk)\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n» Horses:\r\r\n1. Diagnostic procedures-oral and ophthalmic examinations, abdominal palpation, rectal palpation, vaginal examination, catheterization of the bladder and radiographic examinations.\r\r\n2.

Minor surgical procedures.\r\r\n4. Therapeutic medication for sedation and relief of pain following injury or surgery.\r\r\n5. As a preanesthetic to local anesthesia. Xylazine at the recommended dosages can be used in conjunction with local anesthetics, such as procaine or lidocaine.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGY\r\r\n- Xylazine, a non-narcotic compound, is a sedative and analgesic as well as muscle relaxant. Its sedative and analgesic activity is related to central nervous system depression. Its muscle relaxant effect is based on inhibition of the intraneural transmission of impulses in the central nervous system. The principal pharmacological activities develop within 10 to 15 minutes after intramuscular injection in horses and Cervidae, and within 3 to 5 minutes following intravenous administration in horses.\r\r\n- A sleeplike state, the depth of which is dose-dependent, is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours, while analgesia lasts from 15 to 30 minutes. The centrally-acting muscle relaxant effect causes relaxation of the skeletal musculature, complementing sedation and analgesia.\r\r\n- In horses and Cervidae under the influence of xylazine, the respiratory rate is reduced as in natural sleep. Following treatment with xylazine, the heart rate is decreased and a transient change in the conductivity of the cardiac muscle may occur, as evidenced by a partial atrioventricular block. This resembles the atrioventricular block often observed in normal horses. Partial A-V block may occasionally occur following intramuscular injection of xylazine. When given intravenously in horses, the incidence of partial A-V block is higher. Intravenous administration causes a transient rise in blood pressure in horses, followed by a slight decrease.\r\r\n- Xylazine has no effect on blood clotting time or other hematologic parameters.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Horses:\r\r\n1. Dosage: Intravenously-0.5 ml/45 kg body weight (0.5 mg/0.45 kg)\r\r\n- Intramuscularly-1 ml/45 kg body weight (1 mg/0.45 kg)\r\r\n- Following injection of Xylazine, the animal should be allowed to rest quietly until the full effect has been reached.\r\r\n- These dosages produce sedation which is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours, and analgesia which lasts for 15 to 30 minutes.\r\r\n2. Preanesthetic to Local Anesthesia: Xylazine at the recommended dosages can be used in conjunction with local anesthetics, such as procaine or lidocaine.\r\r\n3. Preanesthetic to General Anesthesia: Xylazine at the recommended dosage rates produces an additive effect to central nervous system depressants such as pentobarbital sodium, thiopental sodium and thiamyl sodium. Therefore, the dosage of such compounds should be reduced and administered to the desired effect. In general, only 1/3 to 1/2 of the calculated dosage of the barbiturates will be needed to produce a surgical plane of anesthesia. Post-anesthetic or emergence excitement has not been observed in animals preanesthetized with Xylazine.\r\r\n- Xylazine has been used successfully as a preanesthetic agent for pentobarbital sodium, thiopental sodium, thiamylal sodium, nitrous oxide, ether, halothane, glyceryl guaiacolate and methoxyflurane anesthesia.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cervidae:\r\r\n- Administer intramuscularly, either by hand syringe or syringe dart, in the heavy muscles of the croup or shoulder.\r\r\nDosage Range:\r\r\n- Fallow Deer (Dama dama)-2 to 4 mL/45 kg body weight (2 to 4 mg/0.45 kg).\r\r\n- Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus)-1 to 2 mL/45 kg body weight (1 to 2 mg/0.45 kg).\r\r\n- Sika Deer (Cervus nippon)-1 to 2 mL/45 kg body weight (1 to 2 mg/0.45 kg).\r\r\n- White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus)-1 to 2 mL/45 kg body weight (1 to 2 mg/0.45 kg).\r\r\n- Elk (Cervus canadensis)-0.25 to 0.5 mL/45 kg body weight (0.25 to 0.5 mg/0.45 kg).\r\r\n- Following injection of Xylazine, the animal should be allowed to rest quietly until the full effect has been reached. These dosages produce sedation which is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours and analgesia which lasts for 15 to 30 minutes.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\n- Xylazine in horses and Cervidae, used at recommended dosage levels may occasionally cause slight muscle tremors, bradycardia with partial A-V heart block and a reduced respiratory rate. Movement in response to sharp auditory stimuli may be observed.\r\r\n- In horses, sweating, rarely profuse, has been reported following administration. In Cervidae, salivation, various vocalizations (bellowing, bleating, groaning, grunting, snoring) on expiration, audible grinding of molar teeth, protruding tongue and elevated temperatures have also been noted in some cases.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Careful consideration should be given before administering to horses and Cervidae with significantly depressed respiration, severe pathologic heart disease, advanced liver or kidney disease, severe endotoxic or traumatic shock and stress conditions such as extreme heat, cold, high altitude or fatigue.\r\r\n- Do not use Xylazine in conjunction with tranquilizers.\r\r\n- Analgesic effect is variable, and depth should be carefully assayed prior to surgical/clinical procedures. Variability of analgesia occurs most frequently at the distal extremities of horses and Cervidae. In spite of sedation, the practitioner and handlers should proceed with caution since defense reactions may not be diminished.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Horses:\r\r\n- Since an additive effect results from the use of Xylazine and the barbiturate compounds, it should be used with caution with these central nervous system depressants. Products known to produce respiratory depression or apnea, such as thiamylal sodium, should be given at a reduced dosage and, when injected intravenously, should be administered slowly. When intravenous administration of Xylazine is desired, avoid perivascular injection in order to achieve the desired effect. Studies have shown negligible evidence of tissue irritation, however, following perivascular injection of xylazine.\r\r\n- Intracarotid Arterial Injection Should Be Avoided. As with many compounds, including tranquilizers, immediate violent seizures followed by collapse may result from inadvertent administration into the carotid artery. Although the reaction with Xylazine is usually transient and recovery may be rapid and complete, special care should be taken to assure that the needle is in the jugular vein rather than the carotid artery.\r\r\n- Bradycardia and arrhythmia in the form of incomplete atrioventricular block have been reported following xylazine administration. Although clinically the importance of this effect is questioned, a standard dose of atropine given prior to or following xylazine will greatly decrease the incidence.\r\r\n- Sedation for transport is most successful if actual transportation is begun after the full effect of the drug has been reached and the animal's stability is maintained while standing. In addition, it should be noted that animals under the influence of xylazine can be aroused by noise or other stimuli and this may increase the risk of injury.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Cervidae:\r\r\n- As in all ruminants, it is preferable to administer Xylazine to fasted Cervidae as a safeguard against aspiration of food material into the lungs and/or bloat during deep sedation.\r\r\nCare should be taken to administer Xylazine in the heavy muscles of the croup or shoulder. Injections given subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or into fat deposits will give unpredictable results.\r\r\n- Intra-arterial injection should be avoided, as with many compounds, including tranquilizers, immediate violent seizures followed by collapse may result from inadvertent administration into an artery.\r\r\n- The animal should not be disturbed during induction or until the full effect of the drug has been reached which is usually 10 to 15 minutes following injection.\r\r\n- The usual time to initial effect of the drug is 2 to 5 minutes. The administrator of the drug should be fully cognizant of this interval prior to administration of drug to free-ranging deer or elk, especially at night or in heavily wooded areas.\r\r\n- If the animal has been underdosed (faulty injection or miscalculation on weight) it is advisable to wait one hour before administering a second dose.\r\r\n- Adequate ventilation- especially in cages or crates- is mandatory; keep head and neck in position to insure patient air passage and to prevent aspiration of stomach contents.\r\r\n- During sedation, animals should be prevented from assuming lateral recumbency. A sternal recumbent position is desirable.\r\r\n- While under the effects of Xylazine, the animal should be protected from extreme hot or cold environments.\r\r\n- Efforts should be made to prevent patient from rising until almost complete recovery is attained.\r\r\n- The transportation of Cervidae given Xylazine should be carefully monitored to prevent excessive struggling, injury or death.\r\r\n- Hyperthermic reactions may occur, especially if the subject is in a highly excited state when the drug is administered. Hosing the head and entire body with cold water has usually proven to be an effective deterrent.\r\r\n- The safety of Xylazine has not been demonstrated in pregnant Cervidae. Avoid use during the breeding season.\r\r\n- Cervidae should be observed closely until all of the sedative effects of Xylazine are gone.\r\r\n- Care should be taken at all times when administering Xylazine to Cervidae. This is due to the method of administration (usually darting), the difficulty in estimating body weights and the accepted theory that wild animals are more unpredictable in their response to sedatives and analgesics than the domesticated species.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY\r\r\nXylazine is tolerated at 10 times the recommended dose in horses and at doses above the recommended range in Cervidae. However, some elevated doses produced muscle tremors and long periods of sedation.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING\r\r\n- This drug should not be administered to domestic food-producing animals. Not for use in horses intended for food.\r\r\n- Avoid accidental administration to humans. Should such exposure occur, notify a physician immediately. Artificial respiration may be indicated.\r\r\n- In Cervidae, occasional capture-associated deaths occur. Clinical trials reveal a mortality rate of approximately 3.5% attendant with the administration of xylazine.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORGE\r\r\n- Store at controlled room temperature (15° to 30°C or 59° to 86°F).\r\r\n- NOT FOR HUMAN USE.\r\r\n- KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION\r\r\nFederal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Do not use in Cervidae less than 15 days before or during the hunting season.",

In the presence of maternally derived antibodies, the protection of the vaccine may not be complete until a second vaccination. This second vaccination should be administered at 3-4 months of age and will result in protective immunity that lasts for at least 6 months.\r\r\n-- Single intranasal or intramuscular vaccination of 3 months old animals provides protective immunity (reduction of clinical signs and reduction of viral excretion), which was demonstrated via challenge 3 weeks after vaccination. Reduction of viral excretion is maintained for at least 6 months after single vaccination.\r\r\n-- Revaccination to ensure protection after the initial 6 month protection period has elapsed will result in protective immunity that lasts for 12 months.\r\r\n-- Specific information: No information is available on the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent a latent wild virus infection or to prevent wild virus re-excretion in the latent carrier.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNING\r\r\n- The presence of maternal antibodies can influence the efficacy of the vaccination.\r\r\n- Therefore it is recommended to ascertain the immune status of calves before vaccination is started.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- For use in animals:\r\r\n• Vaccinate only healthy animals.\r\r\n• After intranasal administration, the vaccine virus may spread to in-contact cattle.\r\r\n• Cattle which need to remain totally free from BHV-1 antibodies should be separated from intranasally vaccinated animals.\r\r\n- For the person administering: In case of accidental self injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n• A slight transient rise in temperature (1°C) can commonly occur up to 5 days post vaccination.\r\r\n• An increase of nasal discharge can be commonly observed after intranasal vaccination.\r\r\n• In very rare cases hypersensitivity reactions can occur.\r\r\n• The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals displaying adverse reactions during the course of one treatment)\r\r\n- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals)\r\r\n- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals)\r\r\n- rare (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals)\r\r\n- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\n- Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.\r\r\n- No information is available on the use of this vaccine in breeding bulls.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTION\r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data - in cattle from 3 weeks of age onwards - are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be administered on the same day but not mixed with Bovipast RSP.\r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that for the intramuscular re-vaccination [in cattle from 15 months of age onwards (i.e. those that have previously been vaccinated separately with Bovilis IBR marker live and Bovilis BVD)] this vaccine can be mixed and administered with Bovilis BVD. The product literature of Bovilis BVD should be consulted before administration of the mixed products. The adverse effects observed after administration of one dose or an overdose of the mixed vaccines are not different from those described for the vaccines administered separately.\r\r\n- When mixed with Bovilis BVD at re-vaccination, the demonstrated efficacy claims for Bovilis IBR marker live are as follows:\r\r\n-- Active immunisation of cattle to reduce the fever induced by an infection with BHV-1 and to reduce nasal excretion of field virus.\r\r\n-- Duration of immunity: 12 months demonstrated by serological data.\r\r\n- No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product except the products mentioned above. A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.\r\r\n- Do not use together with immunosuppressive agents.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nReconstitute the lyophilisate with the solvent\r\r\n- 5 doses needs 10 ml solvent\r\r\n- 10 doses needs 20 ml solvent\r\r\n- 25 doses needs 50 ml solvent\r\r\n- 50 doses needs 100 ml solvent\r\r\n- 100 doses needs 200 ml solvent\r\r\nDosage: a single dose of 2 ml reconstituted vaccine per animal.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Method of administration:\r\r\n- from the age of 3 months onwards: intranasal use or intramuscular use.\r\r\n- at an age between 2 weeks and 3 months: intranasal use.\r\r\n- For intranasal use (1 ml in each nostril), the use of a nozzle is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Primary vaccination:\r\r\n- Basic vaccination: Vaccinate each animal from 3 months of age onwards with one single dose.\r\r\n- Early protection schedule: When the first vaccination is given between the age of 2 weeks and 3 months, a second vaccination should be given at an age of 3-4 months.\r\r\n\r\r\n» First revaccination: The first revaccination should be given 6 months after primary vaccination. Bovilis IBR\r\r\nmarker inac can alternatively be used for this revaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Subsequent revaccinations:\r\r\n- All following revaccinations should be given at an interval no greater than 12 months.\r\r\n- Bovilis IBR marker inac can alternatively be used for these revaccinations.\r\r\n\r\r\n- The product literature of Bovilis IBR marker inac should be consulted before using it for revaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For revaccination, the lyophilisate may be reconstituted shortly before use with Bovilis BVD for use in cattle from 15 months of age (i.e. those that have previously been vaccinated separately with Bovilis IBR marker live and Bovilis BVD).

The net effect is to open chloride channels on postsynaptic junction to allow the inflow of chloride ions and induce an irreversible resting state. This results in flaccid paralysis and eventual death of the parasite exposed to the drug.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndication\r\r\n- Treatment and prevention of mixed infections of gastro-intestinal nematodes, respiratory nematodes and certain arthropod parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nRoute of administration:\r\r\n- A single subcutaneous injection in the ear using an 18 gauge, 25 – 40 mm hypodermic needle. The 50ml vial stoppers must not be broached more than 20 times. Use automatic syringe equipment for the 200 ml vial.\r\r\n- To ensure administration of a correct dosage, body weight should be determined as accurately as possible; accuracy of the dosing should be checked.\r\r\n- The injection should be given subcutaneously in the loose tissues on the dorsal surface of the ear, just distal to the distal edge of the auricular cartilage.\r\r\n- The dorsal (outer) surface of the ear should first be cleansed with antiseptic and allowed to briefly air dry. Palpate the edge of the auricular cartilage closest to the head, on the dorsal (hairy) surface of the ear. From this landmark, taking care to avoid blood vessels (artery, vein), the needle should be inserted subcutaneously starting at a point approximately 3 to 3.5 cm distal to this edge (away from the head), and directed towards the base of the ear, and the needle advanced to the hub. At this point, gently aspirate the syringe to confirm that the needle is not in a blood vessel.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage:\r\r\n- 1 ml / 100 kg body weight repeated after 6 months.\r\r\n- Shake vigorously before use.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial warnings species:\r\r\nCare should be taken to avoid the following practices, because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time;\r\r\n- Under-dosing which may due to underestimation of body weight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device (If any).\r\r\n- Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period(s):\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 108 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not permitted for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption or industrial purposes or within 80 days of expected parturition.\r\r\n- The withdrawal period is based solely on a single injection at the ear site of injection.",

It's active against all stages of every major parasitic nematode. It is also a potent ectoparasiticide. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Clorsulon is antiparasitic, approved for use in the treatment of immature and adult forms of Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke) in cattle. Clorsulon inhibits the glycolytic enzymes 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase, thereby blocking the Emden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway: The fluke is deprived of its main metabolic energy source and dies.\r\r\n\r\r\n➡️ Nitroxynil is a member of Substituted Phenols chemical group and is a fasciolicide which is only active by injection. It's active against adult fluke, with some activity against fly larvae (e.g. Cestrusovis) and blood sucking nematodes The mechanism of action is thought to be due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species: Cattle\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nAdult and Immature stages of:\r\r\n- Small brown stomach worm ( including third and fourth stage lanvae and inhibited immatures) caused by Ostertagia ostertagia\r\r\n- Barber's pole worm caused by Haemonchus placei\r\r\n- Stomach hair worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Trichostrongylus axei\r\r\n- Small intestinal worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Cooperia spp\r\r\n- Hookworm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Bunostomum phlebotomum\r\r\n- Nodule worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) caused by Oesophagostomum radiatum\r\r\n\r\r\nAdult stages of:\r\r\n- Whipworm caused by Trichuris spp\r\r\n- Thin necked intestinal worm caused by Nematodirus spp\r\r\n- Intestinal worm caused by Strongyloides papillosus\r\r\n\r\r\nOther internal parasites:\r\r\n- Liver Fluke(early immature (including 2-week old), immat u caused by Fasciola hepatica\r\r\n- Lungworm (adult and immature including inhibited stages) DIctyocaulus viviparous\r\r\n- Eyeworm (aduit) caused by Thelazia spp\r\r\n\r\r\nExternal parasites:\r\r\n- Sucking Lice caused by Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus\r\r\n- Cattle tick caused by Boophilus microplus\r\r\n\r\r\nAids in the control of:\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis\r\r\n- Biting lice: Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administation:\r\r\n- Route: by Subcutaneous injection\r\r\n- For whole product: 1.5 ml / 50 kg body weight\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n- Do not use less than 120 days before slaughter for export.

Also bind to receptors that increase membrane perrneabiiity to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods and causes paralysis and death of the parasites. In mammals, the neuronal receptors to which macrocyclic lactones bind are localized within the central nervous system, a site reached by only negligible concentrations of doramectin.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nCattle and buffalo:\r\r\nGastrointestinal and Lung Worm, Cattle Grubs, Mites and Lice and It also aids in the control of cattle ticks.\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep and Goats:\r\r\nGIT round worms, Lung worms & Nasal Bots.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage: S/C or I/M in neck\r\r\n•  Cattle, Buffaloes, Sheep, Goat and Camel\r\r\n1 ml/50 kg\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period:\r\r\n•  Meat: 35 days ",

A duration of immunity of at least 193 days has been demonstrated against IBR: duration of immunity against BRSV and PI3 has not been established.\r\r\n\r\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\r\nINFORCE 3 is a freeze-dried preparation of temperature sensitive strains of IBR and PI3 viruses and modified live BRSV, packaged with a sterile diluent for rehydration.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY AND EFFICACY:\r\r\n» In a safety study conducted with INFORCE 3, no significant adverse reactions related to vaccination were observed. Safety has been demonstrated in calves as young as 0 days of age, weaned calves, high stressed stockers, and pregnant cows in all 3 trimesters.\r\r\n» Efficacy of the BRSV fraction of INFORCE 3 was demonstrated in two vaccination-challenge studies. Calves were administered either a single 2-mL dose in one nostril or 1-mL doses in each nostril. One hundred percent of calves as young as 3 days of age, vaccinated with a 2-mL dose administered in a single nostril and challenged 49 and 57 days later survived virulent challenge. In both studies, INFORCE 3 vaccinates experienced significantly lower mortality, significantly less lung damage and significantly less viral shedding for a significantly shorter duration than control cattle.\r\r\n» Efficacy of the PI3 fraction was also demonstrated in two vaccination challenge studies, conducted as described above. In both studies, calves vaccinated with INFORCE 3 were protected against a virulent PI3 challenge, as evidenced by shortened durations of Virus shedding, when compared with non-vaccinated control calves.\r\r\n» Short- and long-term efficacy of the IBR fraction were demonstrated in two studies. In the first study, weaned, 7- to 9-month-old vaccinated calves demonstrated 95% less incidence and a 95.6% reduction in disease duration compared to controls when challenged 28 days after vaccination. Researchers also saw favorable impacts on rectal temperatures and nasal shedding of virus. In the second study, calves as young as 3 days of age were vaccinated with a single 2-mL dose and challenged more than 6 months (193 days) later. Vaccinates were observed to have 75.6% less incidence of IBR and a 63.8% reduction in duration of disease compared to controls. Favorable impacts 5 on temperature, nasal shedding, , and antibody titers were also seen.\r\r\n\r\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\r\n» General Directions: Aseptically rehvdrate the freeze-dried vaccine with the sterile diluent provided, shake well, and administer 2 mL intranasally (IN) using a cannula or a syringe with the needle removed.\r\r\n» Primary Vaccination: Place the 2-mL dose in one nostril, or half the dose (1 mL) in each nostril. The presence of maternal antibody is known to interfere with the development of active immunity in cattle, and additional boosters will be required in most young animals.\r\r\n» For advice on revaccination frequency, consult your veterinarian or the manufacturer.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS:\r\r\n» Store at 2°-8°C. Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures and/or direct sunlight may adversely affect potency. Do not freeze.\r\r\n» Use entire contents when first opened.\r\r\n» Sterilized syringes should be used to administer this vaccine. Do not sterilize with chemicals because traces of disinfectant may inactivate the vaccine.\r\r\n» Inactivate unused contents before disposal.\r\r\n» Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n» Contains gentamicin as preservative.\r\r\n» Fetal health risks associated with the vaccination of pregnant animals with modified live vaccines cannot be unequivocally determined during clinical trials conducted for licensure. Appropriate strategies to address the risks associated with modified live vaccine use in pregnant animals should be discussed with a veterinarian.\r\r\n» As with manyvaccines, anaphylaxis may occur after use. Initial antidote of epinephrine is recommended and should be followed with appropriate supportive therapy.\r\r\n» Do not mix with other products, except as specified above.\r\r\n» In case of human exposure, contact a physician.\r\r\n» This product has been shown to be efficacious in healthy animals. A protective immune response may not be elicited if animals are incubating an infectious disease, are malnourished or parasitized, are stressed due to shipment or environmental conditions, are otherwise immunocompromised, or the vaccine is not administered in accordance with label directions.\r\r\n\r\r\nTechnical inquiries should be directed to Zoetis Inc.

While calves are fed colostrum from vaccinated cows during the first two to four weeks of life, these antibodies have been demonstrated to:\r\r\n- reduce the severity of diarrhoea caused by E. coli.\r\r\n- reduce the incidence of scours caused by rotavirus.\r\r\n- reduce the shedding of virus by calves infected with rotavirus or coronavirus.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Dose: Cows and heifers 2 ml.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration: By intramuscular injection. The recommended site is the side of the neck.\r\r\n» The bottle should be well shaken before any vaccine is withdrawn.\r\r\n» A single injection should be given during each pregnancy between 12 and 3 weeks before calving is expected.\r\r\n» Syringes and needles should be sterilised before use and the injection should be made through an area of clean, dry skin taking precautions against contamination.\r\r\n» Colostrum feeding: Protection of calves depends on the physical presence of colostrum antibodies (from vaccinated cows) Within the gut for the duration of the first 2-3 weeks of life until calves develop their own immunity. Thus it is essential to ensure adequate colostrum feeding for the whole of this period to maximise the efficacy of vaccination.\r\r\n» All calves must receive adequate colostrum from their dams within 6 hours of birth. Suckled calves will continue to receive adequate colostrum naturally by feeding from vaccinated cows.\r\r\n» In the dairy herd colostrum/milk from the first 6 - 8 millings of vaccinated cows should be pooled. The colostrum may be stored below 20°C but should be used as soon as possible as immunoglobulin levels may fall by up to 50% after storage for 28 days. Where possible, storage at 4°C is recommended. The calves should then be fed on this pool at the rate of 2½ to 3½ tires per day (according to body size) tor the first two weeks of life.\r\r\n» Optimal results will be obtained if a whole herd cow vaccination policy is adopted. This will ensure that in calves the level of infection and consequent virus excretion is kept to a minimum and consequently the overall level of disease challenge on the farm is kept to a minimum.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ETC.\r\r\n» Warnings: Do not vaccinate unhealthy animals.\r\r\n» No information is available on the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other. It is therefore recommended that no other vaccine should be administered within 14 days before or after vaccination with this product.\r\r\n» Part used containers of the vaccine should be discarded within 28 days of opening.\r\r\n» Side effects: The oil adjuvant provides the convenience of a single shot vaccine and has been carefully chosen to minimize any consequent side effects. It may produce a detectable swelling at the site of injection in a proportion of animals. The injection site reaction gradually reduces in size until it is no longer detectable, usually 14 to 21 days after treatment.\r\r\n» As with all vaccines occasional hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In such cases appropriate treatment such as adrenaline should be administered without delay.\r\r\n» Withdrawal period: Zero days\r\r\n\r\r\n» Operator warning\r\r\n- To the user: If you inject yourself accidentally with this product, go at once to the nearest Accident and Emergency (Casualty) Department of a hospital and show the information printed below to the doctor (or nurse) on duty.\r\r\n- To the doctor: Accidental self-injection with this oil-based product can cause intense vascular spasm which may, for example result in the loss of a digit. Expert PROMPT surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon sheaths.\r\r\n- For animal treatment only. Keep out of reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store between +2°C and +8°C including during transport. Protect from light. Do not freeze. Bovilis Rotavec Corona should not be mixed with other medicaments or vaccines.\r\r\n- Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with national requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nLEGAL CATEGORY\r\r\nPackage quantities 10 ml bottle (5 doses), 40 ml bottle (20 doses).\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n» Calf diarrhea is a complex disease of which rota virus, corona virus and E coli, are three of the most important causal agents in calves in the first few weeks of life. The vaccine will aid in protecting against disease caused by rota virus, corona virus and E coli where these are the sole etiological agents. The vaccine provides no protection against cryptosporidia (for which there is currently no vaccine), but often mixed infections occur and it may help to some degree by providing protection against any concurrent rota virus, corona virus and E coli F5-(K99) and F41 infections. The presence of each agent can be confirmed by laboratory sampling of fresh farces samples ( not swabs) taken directly from calves before any treatment. As the level of passive protection induced by the vaccine is not absolute, corona virus and rota virus infections may occur in calves from vaccinated dams - but will be contained whilst the calf is mounting its own active immune response against the viruses.\r\r\n» F5-(K99) and F41 antigen enables E. coli to adhere to the calf's small intestine where the bacteria multiply rapidly and produce toxins leading to scours, typically in the first few days of life. Specific antibodies can inhibit E. coli sticking to the gut wall and thereby their ability to cause disease. The E. coli F5-(K99) and F41 antigen in Bovilis Rotavec Corona promotes the production of antibodies in colostrum and milk.\r\r\n» In any animal population there may be a small number of individuals which fail to respond fully to vaccination. Successful vaccination depends upon correct storage and administration of the vaccine together with the animal's ability to respond. This can be influenced by such factors as genetic constitution, intercurrent infection age, the presence of maternally derived antibodies, nutritional status concurrent drug therapy and stress.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by Burgwedel Biotech GmbH-Germany\r\r\n(License Holder is Intervet Deutschland GmbH-Germany",

This will contribute to reduce the infection pressure and assure a better epidemiological control of the coccidiosis infection.\r\r\n» Lambs: On rare occasions, in highly susceptible lambs e.g. where they have been housed for long periods of time before being turned out onto heavily contaminated pasture, a severe scour has been seen shortly after dosing. In such cases, fluid therapy is essential and the use of a sulphonamide should be considered. It is also important to consider other potential pathogens that may be playing a role e.g. Cryptosporidium, Nematodirus, Rotavirus, Giardia and E. Coli.\r\r\n» Calves: Clinical coccidiosis generally occurs late in the parasite’s life cycle after most of the damage to the calf’s intestine has already been done. This severely damaged intestine can easily be infected by secondary bacteria and/or other agents. In cases of acute clinical coccidiosis treated with Vecoxan, fluid therapy is essential and the use of an antibiotic should be considered. Symptoms of clinical disease may remain obvious in some calves treated with Vecoxan, even though oocyst excretion is reduced to a very low level, and overall prevalence of diarrhoea is decreased.\r\r\n\r\r\nOPERATOR WARNINGS\r\r\nWash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nNone reported.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY OR LACTATION\r\r\nNot applicable.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n*To ensure the correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lambs:\r\r\n- Therapeutic use: 1 mg diclazuril per kg bodyweight or 1 ml Vecoxan oral suspension per 2.5 kg bodyweight, as a single administration.\r\r\n- Preventative use: 1 mg diclazuril per kg bodyweight or 1 ml Vecoxan oral suspension per 2.5 kg bodyweight at about 4-6 weeks of age at the time that coccidiosis can normally be expected on the farm.\r\r\n- Under conditions of high infection pressure, a second treatment may be indicated about 3 weeks after the first dosing.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Calves:\r\r\n- To aid in the control of coccidiosis: 1 mg diclazuril per kg bodyweight or 1 ml Vecoxan oral suspension per 2.5 kg bodyweight, administered as a single dose, 14 days after moving into a potentially high risk environment.\r\r\n- If a satisfactory response is not observed, then further advice should be sought from your veterinary surgeon and the cause of the condition should be reviewed. It is good practice to ensure the cleanliness of calf housing.\r\r\n\r\r\nMethod of administration\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n- After using draw-off cap, re-close container with original cap. Vecoxan oral suspension should be administered with a drenching gun. Appropriate drenching equipment should be used to allow accurate dosing. This is particularly important when administering small volumes.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\n- Vecoxan oral suspension was given to lambs as a single dose up to 60 times the therapeutic dose. No adverse clinical effects were reported.\r\r\n- No adverse effects were noted either at 5 times the therapeutic dose administered four consecutive times with a 7-day interval.\r\r\n- In calves, the product was tolerated when administered up to five times the recommended dose rate.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\n- Meat and offal:\r\r\n- Lambs: zero days\r\r\n- Calves: zero days\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\nDiclazuril is an anticoccidial triazine derivative of the benzene acetonitrile group and has an anticoccidial activity against Eimeria species. Depending on the coccidia species, diclazuril has a coccidiocidal effect on the asexual or sexual stages of the development cycle of the parasite. Treatment with diclazuril causes interruption of the coccidial cycle and of excretion of oocysts for approximately 2 to 3 weeks after administration. This allows the lambs to bridge the period of decrease of maternal immunity (observed at approximately 4 weeks of age) and calves to reduce the infection pressure of their environment.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PARTICULARS\r\r\n- After administration of the oral suspension, the absorption of diclazuril in lambs is poor. The maximum concentration in plasma is reached between 24 h and 48 h after dosing. The elimination half-life is about 30 hours. The metabolism of diclazuril was studied in vitro using sheep hepatocytes. Studies indicate that at 24 hours after administration, the concentration in edible tissues are far below the Acceptable Daily Intake. As a consequence, there is no need to establish Maximum Residue Limits or to determine a Withdrawal Period.\r\r\n- The absorption of diclazuril when administered as an oral suspension to lambs and calves is poor. In lambs, peak plasma concentrations are reached about 24 hours after dosing. The absorption decreases with the age of the lambs. The elimination half‑life is about 30 hours. In calves, kinetic profiles have been studied after administration of a single dose of 5 mg diclazuril per kg body weight and after dosing for 3 consecutive days at respectively 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg diclazuril per kg body weight. Following the single dose of 5 mg peak plasma concentrations in the range of 21 to 75 ng/ml were reached after 8 to 24 hours. Thereafter the concentrations decreased with an half‑life of 16 hours to concentrations below 10 ng/ml after 48 hours. Following the 3 consecutive daily doses of 1 mg diclazuril per kg body weight, mean peak plasma concentrations of 65.6 ng/ml were reached 10.5 hours after the last dose. Thereafter the concentrations decreased with a half‑life of 22 hours. The AUC0‑96 h was 2127 h.ng/ml. Comparison with the profiles obtained after the multiple doses indicated dose proportionality and linearity. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations and the subsequent depletion half‑life were independent of the dose. Following an oral dose of 5 mg diclazuril per kg body weight only low concentrations of diclazuril distribute to the edible tissues which is another indication of the poor bioavailability. In vitro studies in ovine and bovine hepatocytes indicated that the metabolic transformation of diclazuril is very limited, as was also observed for other species. In vivo studies in a number of animal species have also demonstrated that diclazuril is not excreted and excreted virtually completely unchanged with the faeces.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\nShelf life of the veterinary medicinal product as packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not store above 30 °C.\r\r\n- Protect from frost.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- 200 ml, l litre, 2.5 litre and 5 litre high density polyethylene bottle with high density polyethylene cap (screw fit, tamper evident) with white PVDC coated paper insert.\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste material derived from such a veterinary medicinal product should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.",

Bovilis Bovivac S may also contribute to reducing S. typhimurium contamination of the environment.\r\r\n- Specific experimental data to quantify the duration of immunity or the degree of protection from colostral antibodies has not been generated.\r\r\n- Significant levels of immunity cannot be expected until two weeks after the second dose of the primary vaccination course.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nNone.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS FOR  SPECIES\r\r\nNone.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS FOR USE\r\r\n- All stock showing overt clinical signs of salmonellosis at the time of the initial vaccination programme should receive appropriate treatment and be fully vaccinated once they have recovered. Any unvaccinated stock must be managed separately to vaccinated stock, with no contact between the groups. Hygiene precautions must be instituted, where possible, to prevent transfer of infection from one group to another.\r\r\n- All animals of a herd should be vaccinated.\r\r\n- The effect of maternally derived antibodies has not been studied, but it is likely that high levels of maternally derived antibodies may interfere with the development of active immunity in calves.\r\r\n- A small number of individuals may fail to respond to vaccination as a result of immunological incompetence or for some other reason. In the face of an outbreak of disease, it is therefore important to avoid vaccination of animals which have overt clinical salmonellosis or intercurrent disease or which have a poor nutritional status. Such animals must be isolated and treated as appropriate and then vaccinated upon clinical recovery.\r\r\n\r\r\nOPERATOR WARNINGS\r\r\nNot applicable.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Swellings at the injection site may occur. Typically, these swellings may be warm when compared to the surrounding area for up to 5 days after vaccination, reach a maximum size within 1 - 6 days after vaccination and completely disappear or reduce to clinically insignificant reactions within 2 - 3 weeks after vaccination. In addition, swellings may be slightly painful on palpation for 1 - 2 days after vaccination, although this will not require veterinary intervention.\r\r\n- Occasional hypersensitivity reactions may occur.\r\r\n- If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.\r\r\n- Use during pregnancy or lactation\r\r\n- When vaccinating animals, stress should be avoided, particularly during pregnancy.\r\r\n- The effect of Bovilis Bovivac S administered around service/insemination has not been studied. Limited laboratory and field data suggest that vaccination with Bovilis Bovivac S has no adverse effect on pregnancy and calving.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nNo information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other. It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered within 14 days before or after vaccination with this product.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Vaccination dosage\r\r\n- Calves up to 6 months of age – 2 ml\r\r\n- Adult cattle – 5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\n» Route of administration\r\r\nSubcutaneous injection preferably in the loose skin on the side of the neck, observing aseptic precautions. The use of automatic vaccination equipment is recommended. The vaccine may be administered using a sterile needle and syringe, providing a fresh sterile needle is used each time the rubber cap is punctured, to avoid contamination of the remaining contents.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Primary vaccination course\r\r\n- Where diagnosis of salmonellosis caused by S. dublin and/or S. typhimurium has been confirmed, all at risk adult cattle, including lactating cows, dry cows, heifers, barren cows and in-contact bulls (but excluding any with overt clinical signs of salmonellosis), should receive two 5ml injections separated by an interval of 21 days.\r\r\n- For pregnant cows, this primary vaccination course can be given irrespective of the reproductive status. Any pregnant cows that have not calved within 8 weeks of the second dose of vaccine should receive a further 5ml dose of Bovilis Bovivac S 3 - 4 weeks pre-calving.\r\r\n- Healthy calves from approximately 3 weeks of age may also be given a primary vaccination course. Calves should be given two 2 ml injections separated by an interval of 14 to 21 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Re-vaccination scheme\r\r\n- All cattle vaccinated with the primary vaccination course of Bovilis Bovivac S should receive a 5ml injection at least two weeks prior to each period of risk or at intervals of not more than 12 months thereafter.\r\r\n- As part of an overall herd management programme, for pregnant cattle, it is advised that for each subsequent pregnancy, in order to maintain a sufficient level of active immunisation to reduce S. dublin and S. typhimurium infections under field conditions, a single injection of 5ml should be administered approximately 3 - 4 weeks before calving.\r\r\n- The efficacy of Bovilis Bovivac S has been established in the field using the recommended programme of use. No specific experimental data are available in support of the effectiveness of a single dose re-vaccination.\r\r\n- The use of automatic vaccination equipment is recommended. Use a vaccinator with vented draw-off spike or similar device only.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nAccidental overdose is very unlikely to cause any reaction other than described in point ‘Adverse reactions’, although the swelling may be larger and, together with the associated signs, may last slightly longer. A slightly reduced body weight gain was noticed in some calves that received an overdose. No adverse local or systemic reactions were noted in overdose studies performed in pregnant cows and calves.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\nZero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nDo not mix with any other vaccine or immunological product.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- 24 months. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label.\r\r\n- Once opened, use of the vaccine must be completed within 10 hours.\r\r\n- Partially used containers must be discarded at the end of each day’s operation.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR STORAGE\r\r\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMEDIATE PACKAGING\r\r\nPolyethylene multidose bottles (50 ml) with rubber stoppers sealed with an aluminium crimp cap. The containers and closures comply with the Ph.

The drug binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods and causes paralysis and death of the parasites. Avermectins also enhance the release of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) at presynaptic neurons. GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter and blocks the post-synaptic stimulation of the adjacent neuron in nematodes or the muscle fiber in arthropods. Avermectins are generally not toxic to mammals, since they do not have glutamategated chloride channels and these compounds do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier where mammalian GABA receptors occur.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n» Cattle (Beef and Non-Lactating Dairy): For treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworms: Ostertagia ostertagi (adults, fourth-stage larvae, and inhibited larvae), Haemonchus placei (adults), Trichostrongylus axei (adults and fourthstage larvae), T. colubriformis (adults and fourth-stage larvae), Cooperia oncophora (adults), C. pectinate (adults), C. punctate (adults and fourth-stage larvae), C. spatulata (adults), C. surnabad (adults and fourth-stage larvae), Nematodirus helvetianus (adults), Oesophagostomum radiatum (adults and fourth-stage larvae), Trichuris spp. (adults); lungworms: Dictyocaulus viviparous (adults and fourth-stage larvae); grubs: Hypoderma bovis and H. lineatum; mites: Psoroptes ovis (P. communis var. bovis); lice: Linognathus vituli and Solenopotes capillatus; for protection of cattle from reinfection with D. viviparous and O. radiatum for 42 days after treatment, with H. placei for 35 days after treatment, and with O. ostertagi and T. axei for 14 days after treatment.Moxidectin has a persistent effect against Ostertagia for 5 weeks and against Dictyocaulus for 6 weeks.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species:\r\r\nCattle (Beef and Non-Lactating Dairy).\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage instructions:\r\r\n» Cattle: 1 ml / 50 kg bodyweight as a single subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions:\r\r\n- Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.\r\r\n- It should not be used in newly born domestic animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra–Indications:\r\r\nDo not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects:\r\r\nAdverse effects appear to nonexistent or minimal.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Time:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 21 days.\r\r\n- Milk: Not for use in female dairy cattle of breeding age.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C and used after opening for 40 days when stored at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nCarton box containing amber glass vial type II containing 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 250 & 500 ml with red chlorobutyl rubber stopper capped with flip off aluminum cap with outer label + an insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nE.D.A.

If this is not possible, therapy should be based on local (regional, farm level) epidemiological information about susceptibility of the target bacteria.\r\r\n- Official, national and regional antimicrobial policies should be taken into account when the product is used.\r\r\n- The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be reserved for the treatment of clinical conditions which have responded poorly, or are expected to respond poorly, to other classes of antimicrobials.\r\r\n- Avoid use of the product in herds where no β-lactamase producing staphylococci strains have been isolated. E.coli mastitis with mild to moderate clinical signs, a non-antimicrobial approach should be the first option. Veterinarians should strive to use narrow spectrum antibiotics if possible. Inappropriate use of the product may increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and may decrease the effectiveness of treatment with β-lactam antibiotics, due to the potential for cross-resistance. Most of the ESBLs and AmpC β-lactamases producing E.coli strains may not be inhibited by the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.\r\r\n- The feeding of waste milk containing residues of antibiotics to calves should be avoided up to the end of the milk withdrawal period, except during colostral phase, because it could select antimicrobial resistant bacteria within the intestinal microbiota of the calf and increase the faecal shedding of these bacteria.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor the person\r\r\n- This product may cause skin and eye irritation. Avoid contact with the skin and eyes. In the event of skin or eye contact rinse with plenty of clean water.\r\r\n- The cleaning towels supplied with the product contain isopropyl alcohol, which many cause skin or eye irritation in some people.\r\r\n- The wearing of gloves is recommended during administration of the product and when handling the cleaning towels.\r\r\n- Penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact.\r\r\n- Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa. Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.\r\r\n- Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised, or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.\r\r\n- Handle this product with great care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions.\r\r\n- If you develop symptoms following exposure such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning.\r\r\n- Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing, are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.\r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther precautions\r\r\n- Due to the endocrine-disrupting potential of prednisolone, the product may be dangerous to fish and other aquatic organisms. Consequently treated animals should not have access to watercourses during the first 12 hours after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nIn very rare cases, immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nNo special precautions\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nNone known\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- The syringe must only be used once. Partly emptied syringes due to the unsuccessful use should be discarded.\r\r\n- The content of one syringe should be infused gently into the teat of the infected quarter every 12 hours after each of three consecutive milkings.\r\r\n- Milk out the infected quarters. After thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the teat and teat orifice with the cleaning towels provided, gently infuse the contents of one syringe into each affected quarter. Disperse the product by gentle massage of the teat and udder of the affected animal.\r\r\n- In cases of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a longer course of antibacterial therapy may be required. Therefore overall treatment length must be at the veterinarian’s discretion but should be long enough to ensure complete resolution of intramammary infection.\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMBINATION THERAPY\r\r\nCombined therapy for the treatment of bovine mastitis. In the situation where systemic treatment as well as intramammary treatment is necessary, especially in cases of serious clinical mastitis Combiclav Injection can be administered in combination with this product.\r\r\n• Combiclav Injection\r\r\n- Three injections (24-hour interval) once a day for 3 days.\r\r\n- Where necessary Combiclav Injection may be administered for an additional two days for a total of 5 daily injections.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Combiclav LC Intramammary\r\r\n- Three intramammary infusions (12-hour interval).\r\r\n\r\r\nNote:\r\r\n- First injection and infusion should be in the same time.\r\r\n- To ensure the correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nNo adverse reactions are to be expected from an accidental overdose.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n- Meat & Offal: 7 days\r\r\n- Milk: 84 hours\r\r\n\r\r\nCombined Therapy:\r\r\nWhen using this product and Combiclav Injection in combination:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 42 days\r\r\n- Milk: 84 hours\r\r\nFrom the last treatment of Combiclav Injection following the minimum posology regime.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nNot applicable.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 Year\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Store in a dry place.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- Single dose 3g white LDPE syringes with a white LDPE dual push-fit cap.\r\r\n- Cartons of 3, 12, and 24 syringes, or buckets of 120 syringes including 3, 12, 24, or 120 individually wrapped teat cleaning towels containing isopropyl alcohol.\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Extremely dangerous for fish and aquatic life.

It is very important therefore, that a completely dry needle and syringe is used when extracting suspension for injection in order to avoid contaminating the remaining contents of the vial with drops of water.\r\r\n- Contamination will result in obvious beads of dark, brown discolouration corresponding to the introduced water droplets. Material affected in this way should not be used as it may have significantly reduced potency.\r\r\n\r\r\nii) For the person\r\r\n- Penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact. Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross-reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa.

In the case of Gram-positive bacteria the ß-lactam can freely pass across the peptidoglycan layer in the aqueous phase to the site of activity at the cytoplasmic membrane. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria there is a hydrophobic barrier outside the peptidoglycan layer. Broad-spectrum ß-lactam antibiotics have the ability to cross this barrier by way of small pores in its structure.\r\r\n- There are three major mechanisms of resistance available to bacteria: the production of ß-lactamase enzymes, impermeability of the cell wall by modification of the small pores and by modifications of the amino acid sequences at the cytoplasmic membrane interface where the cell wall is constructed.\r\r\n\r\r\nClavulanic Acid MOA:\r\r\n- In the absence of specific inhibitor enzymes with ß-lactamase activity, ß-lactamases either form complexes with the antibiotic or cause a breakdown of the ß-lactam ring. In either case the antibacterial activity is lost.\r\r\n- Clavulanic acid has a ß-lactam ring in its structure which is recognised by ß-lactamases as a type of “penicillin”. The enzyme/clavulanate interaction is irreversible and results in the depletion of enzymes molecules.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PARTICULARS\r\r\nIt has been documented that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of penicillins (including amoxicillin) after intramammary administration indicate rapid elimination of the drug from milk. The mean residence time has a several-fold lower value than the designated elimination half-life and amounts to only 3.4 h. The concentration of the drug in the milk drop relatively quickly and the process is very dynamic.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 1 year.\r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Keep container in outer carton.\r\r\n- Discard unused material.\r\r\n- This product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\r\r\n- Once a vial has been broached the contents should be used within 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- 50 and 100 ml siliconised, clear, colourless, glass (Type II) vials with nitryl bung secured with aluminium overseal. \r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nMARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER\r\r\nNorbrook Laboratories Limited\r\r\nStation Works, Camlough Road\r\r\nNewry, Co.

The inhibitory effect is on the second step of the enzymatic process, uncoupling the breakage and reunion functions. Danofloxacin, in common with other fluoroquinolones, produces a stable complex between the enzyme and DNA. This results in the cessation of DNA replication and transcription. The bactericidal effect is also observed on bacteria in the stationary growth phase.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATION:\r\r\n- In cattle: Treatment of bovine respiratory disease caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni sensitive to danofloxacin. For the treatment of acute bovine mastitis caused by Escherichia coil sensitive to danofloxacin.\r\r\n- In neo-natal calves: Treatment of enteric infections caused by Escherichia coli sensitive to danofloxacin.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES:\r\r\nCattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE OF ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\nRoute: Subcutaneously injection or intravenously.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Whole Product:\r\r\n- 1 ml / 30 kg body weight as a single injection by the subcutaneous or intravenous route, If clinical signs of respiratory or enteric disease persist 48 hours after the first injection, an additional dose at 6 mg/kg body weight may be administered.\r\r\n- If clinical signs of acute bovine mastitis persist 36-48 hours after the first injection, the antibiotic treatment strategy should be reviewed. It is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of disease and to evaluate the response to treatment within 36-48 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING & PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- It is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of disease and to evaluate the response to treatment within 48 hours.\r\r\n- When fluoroquinolones have been combined with bacteriostatic antimicrobials, such as tetracyclines and macrolides or phenicols, an antagonism was demonstrated in vitro.\r\r\n- Use of fluoroquinolones should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account official and local antimicrobial use policies.\r\r\n- Care should be taken to dose accurately and the product should be used with caution in animals with joint disease or cartilage growth disorders.\r\r\n- Do not use with newly born pet animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not use in cases of known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient, to other (Fluoro) quinolones or any ingredients product the use of the product not recommended for cows during pregnancy.\r\r\n- Do not use cases where the pathogen involved is resistant to other fluoroquinolones (due to the potential or cross resistance).\r\r\n- Not co-administered with nor steroidal and inflammatory agents.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE EFFECTS\r\r\n-In very rare cases in sensitive animals, immediate or delayed anaphylactic shock may occur after the injection.\r\r\n- Subcutaneous injection of the product induces a moderate inflammatory response in the tissue around the injection site. The resultant lesions may persist for up to 30 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL TIME\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 8 days\r\r\n- Milk: 4 days\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C and to be used after opening for 28 days at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\nTransparent colorless glass vial (type II) containing 50, 100 ml solution, closed with chlorobutyl rubber stopper and non-reusable aluminum closures with label + insert leaflet.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nEva Pharma for pharmaceuticals and medical appliances (Eva Pharma) for EVAPHARMA for Pharmaceutical industries (EVAPHARMA).",

By activating the secretion of the seromucous glands, It breaks down the network of acid glycoprotein fibres found in mucoid sputum, which are mainly responsible for the characteristic viscosity.\r\r\n\r\r\nMechanism of Action:\r\r\n- Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Doxycycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which prevents the tRNA from binding to the ribosome. This prevents the mRNA from being translated into protein, which is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction.\r\r\n- Bromhexine acts by inhibiting neuraminidase, stabilizing lysosomes, increasing ciliary activity, hydrating mucus, and exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects.\r\r\n\r\r\nStrength points of Hexacycline:\r\r\n- Hexacycline Synergistic effect: Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which is a common cause of respiratory infections in poultry. Bromhexine is an expectorant that helps to loosen mucus and clear congestion. When used together, doxycycline and bromhexine can be more effective than either drug alone in treating respiratory infections.\r\r\n- Hexacycline Improved absorption: Bromhexine can help to improve the absorption of doxycycline, which means that it is effective in the lower doses.\r\r\n- Hexacycline is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it a versatile antibiotic for poultry.\r\r\n- Hexacycline has a long half-life, meaning it remains in the body for an extended period, providing prolonged protection against bacterial infections.\r\r\n- Hexacycline Reduced Respiratory Distress: By assisting in clearing mucus and improving airway function, bromhexine may contribute to reducing respiratory distress in affected poultry.\r\r\n\r\r\nDose of whole product:\r\r\n- Broilers chickens: 0.5 gm of the product / 1 liter drinking water\r\r\n\r\r\nProduced by EVA PHARMA",

Adjuvant.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Problems caused by Clostridium infections are becoming more common in farm animals everyday, since these microorganisms are generally found in a saprophytic form in the atmosphere and in the intestine of most animals. \r\r\n- Under favourable circumstances (such as sudden changes in diets, excess of proteins in feedstuff, prolonged treatment with antibiotics which provoke the elimination of usual digestive flora, etc.) these microorganisms multiply rapidly and toxins produced by them are absorbed through the intestinal mucus, passing into the blood stream and producing the typical signs of toxaemia (enterotoxaemia).\r\r\n- This often occurs with Clostridium perfringens B, C and D as well as other Clostridium, such as septicum, novyi and chauvoei which under favourable circumstances may propagate and produce toxins which may give rise to dysentery, haemorrhagic enteritis, pulpy kidney disease, hepatitis, black disease, etc.\r\r\n- In order to control these processes, it is essential to impede the action of toxins produced by the different Clostridium. Therefore, an effective vaccine must be capable of inducing adequate levels of antitoxin in vaccinated animals.\r\r\n- TOXIPRA PLUS is a vaccine containing purified toxins and cell antigens, which are duly inactivated and adjuvanted, resulting in a product that induces high levels of specific antibodies, as well as elevated levels of antitoxins. Thus, this product is adequate for the control of different types of clostridiosis.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS:\r\r\n- Adult Sheep and Goats: To prevent Enterotoxaemia (pulpy kidney disease), Necrotic hepatitis, Blackleg and Tetanus.\r\r\n- Lambs and Kids: To prevent Dysentery, Haemorrhagic enteritis, Pulpy kidney disease, Blackleg and Tetanus.\r\r\n- Cattle and Fattening calves: To prevent Enterotoxaemia, Black disease, Necrotic hepatitis, Blackleg and Tetanus.\r\r\n- Suckling calves: To prevent Haemorrhagic enteritis, Enterotoxaemia and Tetanus.\r\r\n- Swine: To prevent Necrotic enteritis, Enterotoxaemia (sudden death in sows) and Tetanus.\r\r\n- Rabbits: To prevent Enterotoxaemia.\r\r\n\r\r\nADMINISTRATION ROUTE: \r\r\n- Subcutaneous or intramuscular.\r\r\n- In sheep and goats only vaccinate by subcutaneous route.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE:\r\r\n- Sheep and Goats: 2 ml/adult animal; and 1 ml/young animal.\r\r\n- Cattle and Fattening calves: 4 ml/animal.\r\r\n- Suckling calves: 2 ml/animal.\r\r\n- Swine: 2 ml/adult pig; and 1 ml/piglet.\r\r\n- Rabbits: 0.5 ml/animal.\r\r\n\r\r\nGenerally, the following vaccination programme is recommended:\r\r\n- First vaccination: Vaccinate and revaccinate within an interval of 20 to 25 days.\r\r\n- Booster vaccination: Administer one dose annually.\r\r\n- Sheep and Goats: In areas where pulpy kidney disease is very prevalent, it is advisable to vaccinate every 6 months (spring and autumn).\r\r\n- Lambs and Kids: Vaccinate from a few days after birth.\r\r\n- Fattening calves: Apply a preventive vaccination at the beginning of the fattening period.

This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyper polarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the relevant parasites. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels. The macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n- Clorsulon is a compound of A benzenesulfonamide family which is recommended for treatment and control of adult forms of Fasciola hepatica& Fasciola gigantic (Liver fluke) in cattle\r\r\n- Clorsulon inhibits glycolytic enzymes of Fasciola hepatica (3-phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase). This enzymatic inhibition effectively blocks the Embden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway and thereby deprives the fluke of its main source of metabolic energy.\r\r\n- Nitroxynil is a halogenated phenol which is effective against Fasciola hepatica with some activity against gastrointestinal nematodes (Haemonchus contortus). Its mode of action is as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation.\r\r\n- Ivernitrosulon when used as recommended dose level, it is effective against sensitive strains of the internal and external parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Treatment and control of sensitive gastro-intestinal roundworms, liver flukes (early immature, immature and adult), lungworms, eye worms, sucking and biting lice, mites, screw worm fly and cattle tick.\r\r\n- Controls 2-week old fluke.\r\r\n- Controls tricabendazole resistant external parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Internal parasites:\r\r\n- Gastro-intestinal round worm: Adult and Immature stages of: Ostertagia ostertagi -(including third and fourth stage larvae and inhibited immatures) Haemonchus placei- Barber’s pole worm - Trichostrongylus axei- Stomach hair worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae)-Trichostrongylus colubriformis- Intestinal hair worm- Ostertagia lyrata-Stomach worm -Cooperia spp-Small intestinal worm (including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae)- Oesophagostomum radiatum - Nodule worm (including third and fourth stage larvae)- Bunostomum phlebotomum(including third and fourth stage inhibited larvae) and Adult stages of:Whipworm- Trichuris spp-Nematodirus spp-Strongyloides papillosus-Thin necked intestinal worm.\r\r\n- Early immature (including 2-week old), immature and adult liver fluke: Fasciola hepatica.\r\r\n- Lungworm (adult and immature including inhibited stages): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n\r\r\n• External parasites:\r\r\n- Eye worm (adult stages): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n- Sucking Lice: Haematopinus eurysternus-short nosed sucking louse, Solenopotes capillatus-little blue sucking louse, Linognathus vituli-long nosed sucking louse.\r\r\n- Cattle tick: Boophilus microplus.\r\r\n- Mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis.\r\r\n- Biting lice: Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis.\r\r\n\r\r\nSustained activity:\r\r\nIvernitrosulon effectively control infection with Ostertagia spp.and Cooperia spp. acquired up to 7 dayes after treatment and Dictyocaulus viviparous and chrysomya bezziana up to 14 days after treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle (Beef and non-lactating dairy cattle)\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage of administration:\r\r\n- Cattle: 1.5 ml / 50 kg BW by subcutaneous injection only (Inject high on the neck behind the ear).\r\r\n\r\r\nWarning & precautions:\r\r\n- Sterilize all injection apparatus by boiling (or equivalent) before use.\r\r\n- Avoid use strong disinfectant on apparatus.\r\r\n- Maintain cleanliness at all times.\r\r\n- Keep needle sharp and clean.\r\r\n- Use shortest needle possible, certainly not exceeding 15 mm.\r\r\n- As far as possible avoid injection of animals during wet weather or under dustily conditions.\r\r\n- This product should be injected only under the skin.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra–Indications:\r\r\n- Do not used intravenously or intramuscularly.\r\r\n- Do not used in cattle which are producing or may in the future produce milk where the milk or milk products may be us for human consumption.\r\r\n- Do not re-treat animals for 120 days (4 months) after last treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n- MEAT: Do not use less than 56 days before slaughter for human consumption.\r\r\n- MILK: Do not use in cattle which are producing or may in the future produce milk where the milk or milk products may be used for human consumption\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage conditions:\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C, away from light and to be used for 3 months after opening at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging:\r\r\nCarton box containing amber glass (type II) vials contains 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 ml and 1 L solution closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and non-reusable aluminum closure with an outer label and insert.\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nEva Pharma For Pharmaceuticals and medical appliances (Eva Pharma)",

Rickettsia, Mycoplasma, spirochaetes, and Actinomyces. Oxtetracycline inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Inside the cell it binds irreversibly to receptors on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome where it interferes with the binding of the amino-acyl transfer RNA to the receptor site on the messenger RNA ribosome complex. This effectively prevents the addition of the amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, inhibiting protein synthesis.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle, sheep and pigs.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Atrophic rhinitis caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.\r\r\n- Navel/joint ill caused by Arcanobacterium pyogenes, E.coli or Staphylococcus aureus.\r\r\n- Mastits caused by Corynebacterium pyogenes, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus uberis.\r\r\n- Metritis caused by E. coli or Streptococcus pyogenes.\r\r\n- Pasteurellosis and infections of the respiratory tract caused by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.\r\r\n- Septicaemia caused by Salmonella dublin and Streptococcus pyogenes.\r\r\n- Erysipelas caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nRoute of administration: By intramuscular or slow intravenous injection in cattle and by intramuscular injection in pigs and sheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Active ingredient:\r\r\n- Cattle: 4 mg oxytetracycline / Kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n- Sheep: 4-9 mg oxytetracycline / Kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n- Pigs: 4-9 mg oxytetracycline / Kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor whole product:\r\r\n- Cattle: 4 ml of product / 50 kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n- Sheep: 4-9 ml of product / 50 kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n- Pigs: 4-9 ml of product / 50 kg.b.wt. daily for 3-5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- When the intravenous route is used in cattle, no more than two consecutive daily injections are administered.\r\r\n- If the volume of product to be administered is greater than 20 ml it should be divided and injected into two sites.\r\r\n- Dilution with solutions of calcium salts will cause precipitation and must be avoided.\r\r\n- Do not use in sheep producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- Use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing of the bacteria isolated from the animal.

        "description": "COMPOSITION:\r\r\nEach 100 ml contains:\r\r\n- Ivermectin  2 gm\r\r\n\r\r\nPROPERTIES:\r\r\nIvermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactones class of endectocides bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES:\r\r\nCattle, sheep and pigs.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS:\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adult and afourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia spp. (including inhibited O. ostertagi),Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis. Cooperia spp., Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Strongyloides papillosus (adult), Nematodirus helvetianus (adult), N. spathiger (adult), Trichuris spp (adult).\r\r\n- Lungworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Dictyocaulus viviparous.\r\r\n- Eye worms (adult): Thelazia spp.\r\r\n- Warbles: Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatum.\r\r\n- Mange mites: Psoroptes bovis Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis.\r\r\n- Sucking lice: Linognathus vituli, Solenopotes capillatu.\r\r\n\r\r\nSheep:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal round worms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Ostertagia circumcincta including inhibited larvae, O, trifurcate, Haemonchus contortus including inhibited larvae, Trichostrongylus axei (adults), T. colubriformis and T. vitrinus (adults), Cooperia curticei, Oesophagostomum columbianum, O. venulosum (adults), Nematodirus filicollis, Chabertia ovina, Trichuris ovis (adults).\r\r\n- Lungworms: Dictyocaulus filaria (adult and fourth-stage larvae), Protostrongylus rufescens (adults), Nasal Bots (all larval stages), Oestrus ovis.\r\r\n\r\r\nPigs:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae): Ascaris suum, Hyostrongylus rubidus, Oesophagostomum spp., Strongyloides ransomi (adult and somatic larval stages).\r\r\n- Lungworms: Metastrongylus spp. (adults).\r\r\n- Lice: Haematopinus suis.\r\r\n- Mange mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\nRoute: Single S/C injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Active Ingredient:\r\r\n- Cattle: 200 mog ivermectin/kg.bwt\r\r\n- Sheep: 200 mcg ivermectin/kg.bwt\r\r\n- Pigs: 300 mcg ivermectin/kg.bwt\r\r\n\r\r\nFor Whole product:\r\r\n- Cattle & Sheep: 0.01 ml / kg.b.wt\r\r\n- Pigs: 0.015 ml / kg.b.wt.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy: Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n- Resistance to ivermectin has been reported Teladorsagia circumcincta in sheep and Ostertagia ostertagi in cattle. Therefore, the use of this product should be based on local (regional, farm) epidemiological information about susceptibility of these helminth species and recommendations on how to limit further selection for resistance to anthelmintics.\r\r\n- Pharmamectin can be used concurrently without adverse effects with foot and mouth disease vaccine or clostridial vaccine, given at separate injection sites.\r\r\n- In the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRADICTIONS:\r\r\n- Do not use in lactating cows or sheep producing milk for human consumption.\r\r\n- to Should not be used in other species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may occur.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS:\r\r\n- Cattle: Transient discomfort has occasionally been observed in cattle following subcutaneous administration.

The lyophilized vaccine is dissolved at the rate of 1000 doses of the vaccine in 30-50 ml of water (the exact amount of water depends on the type of dropper used).\r\r\n- Holding the bird in one hand, place it under the dropper so that one drop falls into the eye. The quality of the use of the vaccine is monitored by the color of the conjunctiva in blue.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Spray Method\r\r\n- An automatic sprayer or a manually controlled sprayer is used to spray the vaccine. When using a manual sprayer, it is important to apply the vaccine to the birds twice.\r\r\n- Calibrate the automatic sprayer (or manually operated sprayer) to spray droplets of the appropriate size. Before carrying out the vaccination, check the correspondence of the size of the drops and the uniformity of the application of the solution by spraying it on any contrasting surface.\r\r\n- The number of doses of the drug is chosen depending on the number of birds to be vaccinated. Pour the vaccine solution into the spray tank and mix gently.\r\r\n- The vaccine solution is replenished every 1.5-2 hours. It is necessary to monitor the operation of the outlet and the temperature of the water (10-20°С). Spraying is carried out from a height of about 40 cm above the heads of the birds. As a result of spraying, the bird should be completely wet.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Vaccination by the large-drop method:\r\r\n- Chickens are vaccinated from the age of one day. 200-300 ml of water is required for every 1000 doses. The size of the drops is 150-250 µ. After spraying, keep the birds for 15-20 minutes in a closed, well-heated room away from drafts until completely dry.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Vaccination by the droplet method:\r\r\n- Chickens are vaccinated no earlier than 12 days of age. 400-500ml of water is required for every 1000 doses.\r\r\n- The size of the drops is 100-150 µ. Gather the birds in one side of the aviary, turn off the ventilation and heating of the room, turn on the light. Spray the vaccine.\r\r\n- Turn on the ventilation 10-20 minutes after the end of the spraying process.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Vaccination check:\r\r\nThe quality of vaccination is controlled by the presence of blue dye on the feathers of the birds, to make sure that the birds are completely wet, run your hand over them.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Method Of Drinking\r\r\n- The day before the vaccine is administered, the volume of water in liters that the bird drinks for 1-1.5 hours is determined. Vaccination should preferably be carried out in the morning.\r\r\n- On the day of vaccination, the vaccine is diluted in such a way that a predetermined volume of drinking water contains one dose of vaccine for one bird.

Drinking water is used for reconstitution and dilution.\r\r\n• The optimal vaccination (revaccination) schedule for poultry in farms is determined based on the epizootic situation and the intensity of immunity.\r\r\n• The effectiveness of immunization against Newcastle disease in vaccinated poultry is determined by the results of AGID in blood serum, expressed as a percentage. Blood serum samples are collected 2-3 weeks after vaccination.\r\r\n• Group immunity is considered to be formed when 80% or more of the tested sera show the following antibody titers after vaccination: In chicks up to one month of age: 1:8 and above; In chicks from 30 to 60 days of age: 1:8 - 1:16 (dominant) and above; In young birds from 60 to 140 days of age: 1:16 - 1:32 (dominant) and above; In adult birds: 1:32 - 1:64 (dominant) and above.\r\r\n• If the effectiveness of immunization is less than 80%, revaccination of the poultry is required.\r\r\n• The initial vaccination of poultry is recommended at 15-21 days of age. After a single administration, the vaccine induces an immune response lasting approximately 6 weeks.\r\r\n• In regions affected by Newcastle disease, the vaccine can be used intranasally or by coarse spray for vaccination of day-old chicks, with subsequent revaccination at 18-21 days of age.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Drinking water method\r\r\n- On the day of vaccination, the contents of the vaccine vials are dissolved in clean room temperature drinking water. The vaccine is diluted in a way that one vaccine dose for one bird is contained in the specified volume of drinking water one day before vaccination.\r\r\n- Drinkers should be thoroughly cleaned before vaccination without adding disinfectant solutions.\r\r\n- For better vaccination performance, it is recommended to use an indicator dye such as \"INDIGO MAX\" or other similar dyes of equivalent quality.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Intranasal method\r\r\n- The vaccine is dissolved in room temperature drinking water at a rate of 10 ml for 100 doses, 100 ml for 1000 doses, 250 ml for 2500 doses, and 500 ml for 5000 doses. Two drops are instilled into the nostril of birds of all age groups, while the second nostril is closed with a finger. If the nasal airways are not permeable, the same volume of vaccine should be instilled into the bird's eye.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Coarse spray method\r\r\n- The vaccine is dissolved in chlorine- and iron-free drinking water at a rate of 250-500 ml for chicks up to one month of age and 500-1000 ml for older birds for 1000 doses. Vaccination is carried out using a sprayer that maintains constant pressure and has a calibrated nozzle.

Ceftiofur Is a Broad-spectrum Cephalosporin Antibiotic That Exerts Its Effect by Inhibiting Bacterial Cell Wall Synthesis. Like Other Β-lactam Antimicrobial Agents, the Cephalosporins Inhibit Cell Wall Synthesis by Interfering with the Enzymes Essential for Peptidoglycan Synthesis. This Effect Results in Lysis of the Bacterial Cell and Accounts for the Bactericidal Nature of These Agents.\r\r\n\r\r\nUes\r\r\nFor use in lactating dairy cows for (1) the treatment of clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and coagulase negative staphylococci and (2) the treatment of diagnosed subclinical mastitis associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Cows with systemic clinical signs caused by mastitis should receive other appropriate therapy under direction of a licensed veterinarian. Note: To limit the development of antimicrobial resistance, treatment of subclinical mastitis with SPECTRAMAST LC should be initiated under veterinary oversight and only after a diagnosis has been supported by a positive culture or other pathogen-specific diagnostic test.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration \r\r\nInfuse one (1) syringe (10 mL) into each infected quarter. Repeat this treatment once in 24 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nDirections for use\r\r\nWash teats thoroughly with warm water containing a suitable dairy antiseptic. Dry the teats thoroughly. Milk out the udder completely. Using an alcohol swab provided, wipe off the end of the affected teat using a separate swab for each teat. Choose the desired insertion length (full or partial) and insert tip into the teat canal; push plunger to dispense the entire contents, massage the quarter to distribute the solution into the milk cistern. Following infusion it is advisable to dip all teats in an approved teat dip.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications \r\r\nAs with all drugs, the use of SPECTRAMAST LC sterile suspension is contraindicated in animals previously found to be hypersensitive to the drug.\r\r\n\r\r\nCautions \r\r\nCows with systemic clinical signs caused by mastitis should receive other appropriate therapy under the direction of a licensed veterinarian. Do not reuse. If redness, swelling and/or abnormal milk persists, discontinue use and consult a veterinarian. It is recommended that milk cultures be used to aid in decision-making for clinical mastitis therapy.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings\r\r\n(1) Milk taken from treated cows during treatment and within 96 hours after the latest treatment must not be used as food.\r\r\n(2) No meat withdrawal period is required when this product is used according to label directions and dosage.\r\r\n(3) To limit the development of antimicrobial resistance: SPECTRAMAST LC should only be used to treat individual cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis. The choice of this product as the most appropriate treatment should be confirmed by clinical experience supported where possible by pathogen culture and drug susceptibility testing. To assure responsible antimicrobial drug use, subclinical mastitis should be diagnosed using a positive culture or other diagnostic test that identifies the pathogen, in addition to appropriate veterinary medical evaluation prior to treatment. The extra label use of this product is not recommended.\r\r\n(4) Penicillins and cephalosporins can cause allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. Topical exposure to such antimicrobials, including ceftiofur, may elicit mild to severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Repeated or prolonged exposure may lead to sensitization. Avoid direct contact of the product with the skin, eyes, mouth and clothing. Sensitization of the skin may be avoided by wearing latex gloves.\r\r\n(5) Persons with a known hypersensitivity to penicillin or cephalosporins should avoid exposure to this product.\r\r\n(6) In case of accidental eye exposure, flush with water for 15 minutes. In case of accidental skin exposure, wash with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing. If allergic reaction occurs (e.g., skin rash, hives, difficult breathing), seek medical attention.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Precautions\r\r\nStore between 15 and 25°C.

        "description": "Composition\r\r\nEach 100 ml contains:\r\r\n- Clindamycin hydrochloride  2.715 gm (equi to Clindamycin base 2.5 gm)\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties\r\r\n- Clindamycin is mainly a bacteriostatic antibiotic belonging to the group of lincosamides.\r\r\n- Clindamycin is a chlorinated analogue of lincomycin. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. The reversible coupling to the sub-unit 50-S bacterial ribosome inhibits translation of amino acids linked to the TRNA, thereby preventing elongation of the peptide chain. That is why the mode of action of clindamycin is predominantly bacteriostatic.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\n• Cats: For the treatment of infected wounds and superficial pyoderma caused by clindamycin-sensitive species of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.\r\r\n• Dogs: For the treatment of infected wounds, superficial pyoderma and oral cavity/dental infections caused by or associated with clindamycin-sensitive species of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Clostridium perfringens.\r\r\n- Adjunctive treatment of mechanical or surgical periodontal therapy in the treatment of infections of the gingival and periodontal tissues.\r\r\n- For the treatment of osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species\r\r\nCats and dogs\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration\r\r\n• Cats:\r\r\nInfected wounds, superficial pyoderma: approximately 0.5 ml Clindamed 2.5 % oral solution / kg of body weight / 24h or 0.25 ml Clindamed 2.5 % oral solution /kg / 12h for 7 to 10 days\r\r\n\r\r\n• Dogs:\r\r\nInfected wounds, superficial pyoderma and oral cavity/dental infections: approximately 0.5 ml Clindamed 2.5 % oral solution / kg of body weight / 24h or 0.25 ml Clindamed 2.5 % oral solution /kg / 12h for 7 to 10 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nTreatment of bone infections (osteomyelitis): approximately 0.5 ml Clindamed 2.5 % oral solution / kg of body weight every 12 hours during a period of 28 days minimum\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions\r\r\n- The treatment should be stopped if no therapeutic effect is observed after 4 days\r\r\n- Inappropriate use of the product may increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to clindamycin. Whenever possible, clindamycin should only be used based on susceptibility testing.\r\r\n- In case of administration of high doses of clindamycin or during prolonged therapy of one month or greater, tests for liver and renal functions and blood counts should be performed periodically.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra Indications\r\r\n- Do not use in rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas, horses or ruminants because ingestion of clindamycin by these species may cause severe gastrointestinal disorders.\r\r\n- Do not use in cases of hypersensitivity to either clindamycin or lincomycin, or to any of the excipients.\r\r\n\r\r\nSide Effects\r\r\n- Vomiting and diarrhoea are occasionally observed.\r\r\n- Clindamycin sometimes causes the overgrowth of non-sensitive organisms such as resistant clostridia and yeasts.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf super infection occurs, the treatment should be stopped and appropriate measures should be taken based on the clinical situation\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time\r\r\nNot applicable\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition\r\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30°C and used after opening for 40 days at temperature not exceeding 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\n10, 15 & 20 ml",

If the pain and agitation of the animal recur after the effect of the product has died off, the injection can be repeated.\r\r\n- In the event of multiple renewals of the injection of the product, long-acting metabolites will accumulate; therefore, the dosage should be reduced accordingly.\r\r\n- The intravenous route will be preferred for urgent procedures.\r\r\n- When injecting intramuscularly, it is preferable to divide the total dose at several points.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\n- Risk of leukocyte depression with repeated administrations.\r\r\n- From 1000 mg/kg, sedation, convulsions, hypersalivation, vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, coma and respiratory arrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 18 days.\r\r\n- Milk: If a withdrawal time for milk is not determined, do not use in female fluid milk producers, in lactation or during the dry period, or in future fluid milk producers within 2 months prior to parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Pigs: Meat and offal: 15 days.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Horses:\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 15 days.\r\r\n- Milk: In the absence of MRLs for milk, do not use in female fluid milk producers, lactating or dry periods, or in future fluid milk producers within 2 months prior to parturition.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOTHERAPEUTIC GROUP\r\r\nOther analgesics, pyrazoles.\r\r\nATC-vet code: QN02BB02.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Metamizole (noramidopyrine or dipyrone) is an NSAID of the pyrazole family, with antispasmodic properties. It is a powerful non-morphine analgesic.\r\r\n- Analgesic, it acts directly at the level of the nerve centers of pain.\r\r\n- Antipyretic and anti-inflammatory, it accelerates the return to a normal state during painful febrile and inflammatory syndromes.\r\r\n- Spasmolytic, it acts on smooth muscle fibers as well as on striated muscle fibers in spastic states caused by pain, inflammation or trauma. This action is accompanied by a vaso-dilator effect that simultaneously ensures better irrigation of the affected areas.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES\r\r\n- The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) appears 1 hour after intramuscular administration.\r\r\n- Metamizole is detectable in plasma only very soon after intravenous injection. It is rapidly converted by hydrolysis to an active metabolite, 4-MAA (= 4-methylaminoantipyrine).\r\r\n- This main metabolite as well as its own metabolites are weakly bound to plasma proteins (58% for 4-MAA). 4-MAA and its metabolites diffuse rapidly into tissues and pass into human milk.\r\r\n- The volume of distribution of 4-MAA in horses is approximately 1.85 L/kg.\r\r\n- 4-MAA is metabolized in the liver. The main route of metabolism is acetylation by cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes. It is either directly involved in 4-MAA or its demethyl metabolite. Acetylated and demethylated 4-MAA undergoes a 2nd sulfo or glucuroconjugation reaction.\r\r\n- Elimination is mainly urine. 90% of the administered dose is eliminated by the kidney. In horses, the elimination half-life of 4-MAA after intravenous administration averages 4.85 h.\r\r\n\r\r\nMAJOR INCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nNot known.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nNo special storage precautions.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\nColoured glass bottle type II Chlorobutyl cap Aluminium capsule\r\r\n- Box of 1 vial of 20 ml\r\r\n- Box of 1 vial of 100 ml\r\r\n- Not all presentations may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nEmpty packaging and any remaining product must be disposed of in accordance with current practices governed by waste regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nMarketing authorisation holder\r\r\nVETOQUINOL, MAGNY VERNOIS, 70200 LURE",

Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve or muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\r\r\n- The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels; the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels, and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n» Gastrointestinal roundworms:\r\r\n- Adult, immature and Inhibited L4 brown Stomach Worm (Ostertagia spp, including Ostertagia ostertagi, Ostertagia Leptospicularis, Ostertagia lyrata).\r\r\n- Adult, immature and Inhibited L4 Barbers Pole Worm(Haemonchus contortus).\r\r\n- Adult and immature Stomach Hair Worm (Trichostrongylus axei).\r\r\n- Adult and immature Intestinal Hair Worm (Trichostrongylus colubriformis).\r\r\n- Adult, immature and Inhibited L4 Small Intestinal Worm (Cooperia spp. Including Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia curticei).\r\r\n- Adult and immature Thin Necked Intestinal-Worm (Nematodirus helvetianus).\r\r\n- Adult and immature Hookworm(Bunostomun phlebotomum).\r\r\n- Adult and immature Nodule worm (Oesophagostomum radiatum).\r\r\n- Adult Whipworm (Trichuris spp).\r\r\n\r\r\n» Lungworms:\r\r\n- Adult and immature Dictyocaulus filaria.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget Species:\r\r\nCattle\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & administration:\r\r\n- Single administration 1 ml of product / 50 kg bodyweight by subcutaneous injection in the anterior of the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings & Precautions:\r\r\n• Do not use in newborn domestic animals.\r\r\n• Must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n• Care should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n- Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n- Underdosing, which may be due to underestimation of bodyweight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device (if any).\r\r\n- Very toxic to aquatic and invertebrate organisms, may cause long-term effects to the environment.

Amprolium competitively inhibited both systems; however, the parasite was shown to be more sensitive to amprolium than the host.\r\r\n- As shown with Eimeria maxima inoculated chicken, the administration of Amprolium resulted in a proportion of morphologically abnormal macrogametes and oocysts which maybe considered the reason for a reduced sporulation rate.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nTreatment of intestinal coccidiosis in chickens (broilers, pullets, layers, breeder hens) caused by Eimeria (E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. mitis, and E. tenella) and turkeys caused by (E. meleagrimitis, E. adenoeides, and E. gallopavonis) susceptible to amprolium.\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nChickens (broilers, pullets, layers, breeder hens) and turkeys.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\r\n- Route of administration: Orally in drinking water.\r\r\n- 1 gm of the product / 10 kg body weight Eq to 20 mg amprolium / kg b.w.(1 gm /1 liter drinking water) daily for 5 - 7 consecutive days.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarnings:\r\r\n- As with any antiparasiticide, frequent and repeated use of antiprotozoals from the same class may lead to the development of resistance.\r\r\n- In case of detection a lack of efficacy during treatment.communicate it to the national competent authorities.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\n- The product is not intended for a preventive use.\r\r\n- This product should be reserved in case of coccidiosis outbreaks due to non-availability of vaccine, in case of lack of efficacy of vaccine and in vaccinated flocks if a severe coccidial challenge is diagnosed before immunity has fully developed.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse reactions: None known.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions:\r\r\nThe efficacy of amprolium may be reduced during a simultaneous administration of products containing vitamin B-complex.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal time:\r\r\n» Chickens (broilers, pullets, layers, breeder hens):\r\r\n- Meat & offal: Zero days..\r\r\n- Eggs: Zero days.Turkeys: Meat & offal: Zero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage condition:\r\r\nStore before opening for 3 years in a temperature not exceeding 30°C, in dry place and after opening for 6 months in a temperature not exceeding 30°C, in dry place and after reconstitution for 24 hours in a temperature not exceeding 30°C, away from direct sunlight & keep out of reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nM.

Once the first calf has been treated, all the forthcoming new-born calves must be systematically treated as long as the risk for diarrhoea due to C. parvum persists.\r\r\n- Bottle without a pump: To ensure a correct dosage, the use of either a syringe or any appropriate device for oral administration is necessary.\r\r\n- Bottle with a pump: To ensure a correct dosage, the most appropriate metering pump should be selected, depending on the weight of the animals to be treated. In cases where the dosing pump is unsuitable for the weight of animals to be treated, either a syringe or any other appropriate device can be used.\r\r\n\r\r\n4 ML PUMP\r\r\n1- Choose the dip tube designed for the height of the bottle (the shorter one for the 490 ml bottle and the longer one for the 980 ml bottle) and insert it into the free hole located in the base of the pump cap.\r\r\n2- Remove the cap of the bottle and protective seal from the bottle and screw the pump on.\r\r\n3- Remove the protector cap from the tip of the nozzle of the pump.\r\r\n4- Prime the pump by pressing the trigger gently, until a drop appears at the tip of the nozzle.\r\r\n5- Restrain the calf and insert the nozzle of the metering pump into its mouth.\r\r\n6- Pull the trigger of the metering pump completely for release of a dose that equals 4 ml of solution. Pull two or three times, respectively, for administration of the desired volume (8 ml for calves weighing more than 35 kg but less than or equal to 45 kg and 12 ml for calves weighing more than 45 kg but less than or equal to 60 kg). For lighter or heavier animals, a precise calculation should be performed (2 ml/10 kg bw).\r\r\n7- Continue using until the bottle is empty. If product remains in the bottle, leave the pump attached until further use.\r\r\n8- Always replace the cap on the tip of the nozzle after use.\r\r\n9- Always replace the bottle in the box.\r\r\n\r\r\n4 TO 12 ML PUMP\r\r\n1- Choose the dip tube designed for the height of the bottle (the shorter one for the 490 ml bottle and the longer one for the 980 ml bottle) and insert it into the free hole located in the base of the pump cap.\r\r\n2- Remove the cap of the bottle and protective seal from the bottle and screw the pump on.\r\r\n3- Remove the protector cap from the tip of the nozzle of the pump.\r\r\n4- To prime the pump, turn the dosage ring and select 60 kg (12 ml).\r\r\n5- Press the trigger gradually with the cannula pointed up, until a drop appears at the tip of the nozzle.\r\r\n6- Turn the ring, in order to select the weight of the calf to be treated.\r\r\n7- Restrain the calf and insert the nozzle of the metering pump into its mouth.\r\r\n8- Pull the trigger of the metering pump completely for release of the adequate dose.\r\r\n9- Continue using until the bottle is empty. If product remains in the bottle, leave the pump attached until further use.\r\r\n10- Always replace the cap on the tip of the nozzle after use.\r\r\n11- Always replace the bottle in the box.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\nThe active substance, halofuginone, is an antiprotozoal agent of the quinazolinone derivatives group (nitrogenous polyheterocycles). Halofuginone lactate is a salt whose antiprotozoal properties and efficacy against Cryptosporidium parvum have been demonstrated both in in vitro conditions and in artificial and natural infections. The compound has a cryptosporidiostatic effect on Cryptosporidium parvum. It is mainly active on the free stages of the parasite (sporozoïte, merozoïte). The concentrations to inhibit 50% and 90% of the parasites, in an in vitro test system, are IC50 < 0.1 μg/mland IC90 of 4.5 μg/ml, respectively.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOKINETIC PARTICULARS\r\r\nThe bioavailability of the drug in the calf following single oral administration is about 80%. The time necessary to obtain the maximum concentration Tmax is 11 hours. The maximum concentration in plasma Cmax is 4 ng/ml. The apparent volume of distribution is 10 l/kg. The plasmatic concentrations of halofuginone after repeated oral administrations are comparable to the pharmacokinetic pattern after single oral treatment. Unchanged halofuginone is the major component in the tissues. Highest values have been found in the liver and the kidney. The product is mainly excreted in the urine. The terminal elimination half-life is 11.7 hours after IV administration and 30.84 hours after single oral administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nAs symptoms of toxicity may occur at twice the therapeutic dose, it is necessary to apply the recommended dosage strictly. Symptoms of toxicity include diarrhoea, visible blood in faeces, decline in milk consumption, dehydration, apathy and prostration. Should clinical signs of overdosing occur, the treatment must be stopped immediately and the animal fed unmedicated milk or milk replacer. Rehydration may be necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 13 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 6 months.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Keep the bottle in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\r\r\n- Store upright in the original packaging.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- Cardboard box containing one 500 ml bottle (high-density polyethylene) containing 490 ml of solution or one 1000 ml bottle containing 980 ml of solution, sealed with a high density polyethylene cap, with or without a metering pump, with two different lengths dip tubes (22 and 24 cm) made of ethylene-vinyl acetate.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Boxes with a metering pump:\r\r\n• 4 ml pump: Each package also contains a plastic metering pump delivering 4 ml volumes and two dip tubes (one to fit a 500 ml bottle and one to fit a 1000 ml bottle).\r\r\n• 4 to 12 ml pump: Each package also contains a plastic metering pump delivering 4 to 12 ml and two dip tubes (one to fit a 500 ml bottle and one to fit a 1000 ml bottle).\r\r\n- Not all pack sizes may be marketed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Any unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal product should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n- The product should not enter watercourses as this may be dangerous for fish and other aquatic organisms.",

        "description": "Composition:\r\r\nEach 1 ml contains:\r\r\n- Moxidectin 10 mg\r\r\n- Clorsulon 100 mg\r\r\n\r\r\nProperties:\r\r\n- Moxidectin is a parasiticide active against a wide range of internal and external parasites and is osecond generation, macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin family Its principal mode of action s interference with neuramuscular transmission of the GABA (gamma amino butyric acid)-gated or glutomate-gated chloride channels\r\r\n- Moxidectin stimulates the release of GABA and increases its binding to the postsynaptic receptors The net effect is to open the chloride channels on the postsynaptic junction to allow the inflow of chloride ions and induce an irreversible resting state. These results in flaccid paralysis and eventual death of parasites exposed to the drug.\r\r\n- Clorsulon is a compound belonging to the benzene sulphonamide family which is recommended for the control of adult liver flukes (Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica) in cattle. Clorsulon inhibits the enzymes implicated in the glycolytic pathway, the primary source of energy in flukes The product is effective against all the important internal parasites in cattle sensitive to one or both of moxidectin and clorsulon.\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\nCattle:\r\r\n- Treatment of moxidectin and clorsulon sensitive internal parasites of cattle.\r\r\n- It contains moxidectin, a member of the milbemycin / avermectin family of anthelmintics, and clorsulon, a sulphonamide which kills liver flukes by inhibiting their glycolytic pathway enzymes when ingested.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is effective against sensitive strains of the following parasites:\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworms (adult and immature stages): Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi (include inhibited larvae), Ostertagia lyrata, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus longispicularis, Cooperia memasteri, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctate, Nemiatodorius spathuger (adults only), Nematodorius helvetianus (adults only), Bunestomum phlehotomum, Oesophagostomum rudiatum, Trichuris sp (adults only).\r\r\n- Lungworm (adult and immature)\r\r\n- Liver Fluke: Fasciola hepatica (adult)\r\r\n\r\r\nTarget species:\r\r\nCattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and administration:\r\r\n- Route: by subcutaneous injection (just under the skin) on the side of the neck, preferably high up behind the ear.\r\r\n- For the whole product: 1 ml for every 50 kg of body weight by subcutaneous injection into the anterior half of the neck.\r\r\n\r\r\nWarning & Precautions:\r\r\n- Do not exceed the stated dose volume.\r\r\n- Divide doses greater than 10 ml between two injection sites to reduce the occasional discomfort or site reactions.\r\r\n- May be harmful if swallowed.\r\r\n- Suspected of causing genetic defects.\r\r\n- Suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child.\r\r\n- May cause harm to breast fed children.\r\r\n- May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure.\r\r\n- Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects.\r\r\n- Harmful to the soil environment.\r\r\n- Harmful to terrestrial vertebrates.\r\r\n- Toxic to terrestrial invertebrates.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\nNot to be used in animals vaccinated against foot rot.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdverse Effects:\r\r\nTransitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous injection.

Chicks should have maternal haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titre to NDV of ≤ 2^3 at the time of vaccination for an optimal response.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTENTS:\r\r\nThe product consists of a freeze dried pellet in a 3 mL glass vial containing 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 doses per vial OR a freeze dried pellet in a 10 mL glass vial containing 5000, 10,000 or 20,000 doses per vial.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications:\r\r\n• This product is contraindicated for vaccinating unhealthy birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions:\r\r\n• Administer only as directed and use entire contents when first opened.\r\r\n• Always keep the vaccine cool and away from sunlight.\r\r\n• Vaccinate all chickens at the one time and administer a full dose to each chicken.\r\r\n• Early morning vaccination is recommended to ensure rapid consumption of water by the birds in conditions of temperature and light most favourable for effective vaccination and minimum stress to the flock.\r\r\n• Vaccine must be consumed within two hours of preparation.\r\r\n• Maintain chickens under good husbandry and environmental conditions and minimise exposure to stressful conditions and disease causing viruses especially during the first two weeks after vaccination.\r\r\n• Wash and disinfect hands after use. \r\r\n\r\r\nIndications:\r\r\n- Vaccination in the presence of maternal antibodies may delay the onset, and reduce the magnitude, of active immunity development. \r\r\n- Monitoring of HI antibody levels in the serum of chickens is recommended. Antibody levels should be ≥ 2^3 to protect against mortality.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage and Administration:\r\r\nBroiler Chickens: Vaxsafe ND can be administered to broiler chickens from 7 days of age. The preferred program is to administer the vaccine once between 7 and 14 days of age.\r\r\n\r\r\nMethod of Vaccination:\r\r\nPreparation of Vaccine for Drinking Water Administration\r\r\n• Rainwater or clean bore/dam water should be used, if available, to prepare vaccine. Avoid heavily chlorinated water if possible. If chlorinated water is used, it should be left to stand overnight to permit the chlorine to dissipate.\r\r\n• No medication, disinfectants or detergents should have been used in the containers for mixing the vaccine or in the drinking system for 48 hours before vaccination.\r\r\n• Skim milk powder, when used as recommended, acts as a stabiliser and protects the live virus in the vaccine.\r\r\n• Calculate the total number of doses of vaccine required, based on the total bird number of chickens in the shed rounded up to the nearest whole vial.\r\r\n• Remove the number of vials required from the deep freeze to a dust-free area out of direct sunlight.\r\r\n• Prepare a small volume (1 litre) of tap water containing 2.5 g/L of skim milk powder in a screw capped container to act as the diluent for the vaccine.\r\r\n• Remove the caps and stoppers from the vials.\r\r\n• Using a 5 or 10 mL syringe, dissolve each plug of freeze-dried vaccine with about 2-3 mL of the prepared diluent.\r\r\n• Withdraw the dissolved contents from all of the vials back into the diluent container.\r\r\n• Shake the container well and hold in the refrigerator until ready for use.\r\r\n• Vaccine should be administered as soon as possible after preparation.\r\r\n• Only use a plastic bucket and utensils to prepare vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nPreparation of Diluent\r\r\n• Select a suitable container depending upon the chosen method of drinking water vaccination (medication tank or directly into drinkers) and mix skim milk powder with clean water at the rate of 2.5 g of powder to 1 litre of water.\r\r\n\r\r\nVaccination Procedure\r\r\n• Vaccine may be administered to chickens through the drinking water using a medication tank method or by directly dispensing into the drinking fonts.\r\r\n\r\r\nMedication Tank Method\r\r\n• Do not administer any medication or disinfectants in the drinking water within 48 hours prior to or following vaccination.\r\r\n• Determine the drinking water consumption of the chickens over a two-hour period on the day before vaccination.\r\r\n• On the morning of the day of vaccination, turn off the main water supply and thoroughly clean all drinking fonts. Do not use disinfectants during cleaning.\r\r\n• The medication tank should be emptied and cleaned. Do not use disinfectants during cleaning.\r\r\n• Fill the medication tank with the amount of water that you calculated would last the chickens two hours of water consumption. Add skim milk powder at the rate of 2.5 g/Land mix this thoroughly with the fresh water in the tank.\r\r\n• Tip the previously prepared vaccine into the tank and again mix thoroughly.\r\r\n• Turn on the medication tank and drain off any clear water until the water containing the skim milk powder and vaccine appears as a cloudy white colour. Allow the drinkers to fill and then encourage all the chickens to consume the vaccine/water.\r\r\n• Continue to encourage consumption of all of the vaccine/water over the next two hours.\r\r\n• Turn on the main water supply only after all of the vaccine mixture has been consumed.\r\r\n\r\r\nDirectly into Drinking Fonts\r\r\n• As described above, determine the water consumption of the chickens over two hours.\r\r\n• Turn off the main water supply and then clean, rinse and empty the water troughs.\r\r\n• Avoid the use of disinfectants or detergents during cleaning.\r\r\n• Prepare the vaccine initially in a one-litre volume as described above.\r\r\n• Prepare a larger volume of water (eg in a clean plastic garbage bin) equivalent to the volume of water that the birds will consume over a two-hour period. Add skim milk powder at the rate of 2.5 g/L and mix thoroughly.\r\r\n• Mix in the previously prepared vaccine and thoroughly stir the mixture.\r\r\n• Distribute the vaccine mixture with a clean container to all the drinking fonts in the shed.\r\r\n• Encourage the birds to drink and ensure that the fonts continue to be topped-up until all the vaccine/water is consumed.\r\r\n• The vaccine/water should be consumed within two hours.\r\r\n• Ensure that the chickens only have access to the vaccine/water and not to any other water supplied during this two-hour period.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD: NIL.\r\r\n\r\r\nUSER SAFETY INFORMATION:\r\r\nNewcastle disease vaccines can cause conjunctivitis if accidentally splashed or sprayed into the eyes of an operator. Eye protection should, therefore, be worn when handling vaccine, and medical advice sought if accidental contact with the eyes occurs.\r\r\n\r\r\nFIRST AID:\r\r\n• If swallowed, rinse mouth with clean, fresh water and swallow some clean water.\r\r\n• If splashed into the eye, hold eyes open and gently wash material from them with clean running water. Ensure irrigation under eyelids by lifting them. Do not attempt to remove contact lenses unless trained to do so.\r\r\n• If skin becomes contaminated, wash affected area with soap and water. If irritation occurs, seek medical advice\r\r\n• If inhaled, remove person to fresh air and observe until recovered. If irritation or other symptoms persist, seek medical advice.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\r\r\nStore below -18⁰C (deep freeze).\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL: \r\r\nDispose of vials/containers should immediately a designated and \r\r\nappropriately labelled ‘biologicals’ container. If this option is not available, discard unused vaccine and empty vaccine vials into a disinfectant solution (e.g. chlorine based bleach). Dispose of any such inactivated, unused vaccine and empty containers by wrapping in paper and putting in garbage. In cases of spillage, soak up the liquid with an absorbent sponge or cloth and incinerate. Treat the surface with a disinfectant solution (e.g., chlorine based bleach).\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION:\r\r\nThe capability of this vaccine to produce satisfactory results depends upon many factors including, but not limited to, conditions of storage and handling by the user, administration of the vaccine, health and responsiveness of individual chickens and degree of field exposure. Therefore, directions for use should be followed carefully.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTACT DETAILS:\r\r\nBIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd\r\r\nACN 007 303 728\r\r\n36 Charter Street\r\r\nRingwood\r\r\nVictoria 3134, Australia\r\r\nPH: 03 9871 2000\r\r\nFAX: 03 9876 0556\r\r\n\r\r\nWARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER\r\r\n- Vaxsafe ND has been tested and meets safety and potency standards according to the Standards required by the APVMA.\r\r\n- BIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd accepts no responsibility for events arising from the misuse or mishandling of the product.\r\r\n- BIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd gives no warranty (express or implied) with respect to the product, including without limitation any warranty as to completeness, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

In the case of accidental oral intake or self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet to the doctor but DO NOT DRIVE as sedation and changes in blood pressure may occur.\r\r\n2. Avoid skin, eye or mucosal contact.\r\r\n3. Immediately after exposure, wash the exposed skin with large amounts of fresh water.\r\r\n4. Remove contaminated clothes that are in direct contact with skin.\r\r\n5. In the case of accidental contact of the product with eyes, rinse with large amounts of fresh water. If symptoms occur, seek the advice of a doctor.\r\r\n6. If pregnant women handle the product, special caution should be observed not to self inject as uterine contractions and decreased foetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure.\r\r\n7. Advice to Doctors: Xylazine is an alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist. Symptoms after absorption may involve clinical effects including dose-dependent sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, a dry mouth, and hyperglycaemia. Ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported. Respiratory and haemodynamic symptoms should be treated symptomatically.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nSide-effects of bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia and polyuria may occur. Following intravenous administration a transient rise followed by a fall in blood pressure usually occurs.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\n- Chanazine 10% should not be administered during the last month of pregnancy because of the risk of inducing premature parturition.\r\r\n- As the safety of xylazine use during organogenesis has not been fully demonstrated by current methods it should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\n- Analeptics will reduce the depth, or shorten the period of sedation.\r\r\n- Mixing of xylazine with other agents in the same syringe is not advised.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Chanazine 10% is given by intramuscular or intravenous administration. Intravenous injection should be slow taking from one to two minutes to administer. Dosage depends on the degree of sedation required and the response of the animal.\r\r\n- Chanazine 10% is administered by intravenous injection at a dose rate of 0.5 - 1 ml/100 kg bodyweight (0.5 - 1 mg/kg) or intramuscularly at a dose rate of 1 - 2 ml/100 kg bodyweight (1 - 2 mg/kg). Animals do not usually become recumbent with Chanazine 10% and light to deep sedation with variable degree of analgesia is obtained. Effects are usually seen within 10 to 15 minutes after intramuscular administration and within 5 minutes following intravenous administration. A sleep-like state the depth of which is dose dependent is usually maintained for 1 - 2 hours, while analgesia lasts from 15 - 30 minutes. Chanazine 10% may be employed as a pre-medication to barbiturate anaesthesia or in combination with regional or local anaesthesia. When used as a pre-anaesthesia medication the dose rate of barbiturate should be reduced to a quarter to half of normal.\r\r\n- Nervous or excitable horses may require higher doses. Older horses and those having undergone severe physical exertion before treatment should receive the lowest dose rate.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nAlpha-2 blockers such as atipamezole are effective in reversing the sedation and other physiological effects of xylazine.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\nMeat and offal: 5 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: Nervous system, psycholeptics, hypnotics and sedatives; xylazine, ATC vet code: QN05CM92\r\r\n- Chanazine 10% is an injectable solution containing Xylazine Base 100 mg/ml. Xylazine is an α2-adrenergic drug with sedative, analgesic and muscle relaxing properties which acts via the CNS. Xylazine is thought to act by activation of the central presynaptic α2-receptors. Activation of these central α2-receptors seems to regulate central dopamine and norepinephrine storage or release. Xylazine’s analgesic and sedative actions are related to its central nervous system depression, while the muscle relaxant effects are due to the inhibition of the intraneural transmission of impulses in the central nervous system.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 5 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 6 months.\r\r\n- Store below 25C.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- 50 ml of clear, colourless sterile solution contained in 55 ml amber injection vials, Type I Ph.

        "description": "Active Constituent:\r\r\nEach dose, contains ≥ 10^2.4 EID50 living, Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Vaccine Strain V877.\r\r\n\r\r\nStatement of Claims:\r\r\nFor active immunisation of chickens from 14 days of age against virulent Infectious Bursal Disease. \r\r\n\r\r\nA freeze-dried live virus vaccine of intermediate virulence derived from a mild field strain of Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBDV) isolated in Australia. The vaccine virus has been purified and grown in chicken embryos derived from specific  pathogen free [SPF] flocks. The vaccine may be given to chickens at or over 14 days of age with maternal antibodies to IBDV by oral administration through the drinking water.\r\r\n\r\r\nContents:\r\r\nThe product consists of one glass vial of vaccine. Each vial of vaccine contains a minimum of 1000/2000 doses of vaccine.\r\r\n \r\r\nContraindications: \r\r\n• This product is contraindicated for vaccinating unhealthy birds. \r\r\n \r\r\nPrecautions: \r\r\n• Administer only as directed and use entire contents when first opened. \r\r\n• Always keep the vaccine cool and away from sunlight. \r\r\n• Vaccinate all chickens at the one time and administer a full dose to each chicken. \r\r\n• Early morning vaccination is recommended to ensure rapid consumption of water by the birds in conditions of temperature and light most favourable for effective vaccination and minimum stress to the flock. \r\r\n• Vaccine must be consumed within two hours of preparation. \r\r\n• Maintain chickens under good husbandry and environmental conditions and minimise exposure to stressful conditions and disease causing viruses especially during the first two weeks after vaccination. \r\r\n• Do not administer other live vaccines within 14 days of the administration of this vaccine.\r\r\n• Wash and disinfect hands after use. \r\r\n \r\r\nDosage And Administration:\r\r\nBroiler Chickens: Vaxsafe® IBD should be administered to broiler chickens at or over 14 days of age in the face of declining maternal antibodies to IBD virus. \r\r\n\r\r\nCalculation of vaccination day: It is recommended that in\r\r\norder to vaccinate the chickens correctly, the day on which the\r\r\nIBD ELISA antibody titre of the chickens declines to reach the \r\r\noptimum vaccination titre should be calculated. This titre can \r\r\nbe estimated from the results of blood samples collected from \r\r\nday-old chicks. The following procedure should be adopted: \r\r\n• At least twenty (20) day-old chicks should be sacrificed so that blood samples can be collected from each.\r\r\n• The samples should be sent to a diagnostic laboratory that can test the samples for their IDEXX® IBDV antibody ELISA titre.\r\r\n• The day on which the vaccine should be administered is when the mean antibody ELISA titre is approximately 250 in the face of challenge from immunosuppressive IBD viruses or 500 in the face of challenge from virulent IBD viruses.\r\r\n• Assume that maternal antibody levels in broiler chickens decline by 50% every 3.5 days.\r\r\n• Where broiler flocks are derived from a number of parent flocks of different ages, a wider spread of maternal antibody titres should be anticipated and choice of the optimum vaccination age becomes more difficult.\r\r\n• Under such circumstances, it may be preferable to err on the side of a later vaccination age to avoid neutralisation of the vaccine virus by high levels of maternal antibody in some of the progeny  chickens.\r\r\n\r\r\nMethod Of Vaccination:\r\r\nPreparation of Vaccine for Drinking Water administration\r\r\n• Rainwater or clean dam water should be used, if available, to prepare vaccine. Avoid heavily chlorinated water if possible. If chlorinated water is used, it should be left to stand overnight to permit the chlorine to dissipate;\r\r\n• No medication, disinfectants or detergents should have been used in the containers for mixing the vaccine or in the drinking system for 48 hours before vaccination;\r\r\n• Skim milk powder, when used as recommended, acts as a stabiliser and protects the live virus in the vaccine;\r\r\n• Calculate the total number of doses of vaccine required, based on the total bird number of chickens in the shed rounded up to the nearest whole vial. \r\r\n• Remove the number of vials required from the deep freeze to a dust-free area. \r\r\n• Prepare a small volume (1 litre) of tap water containing 2.5 gm/litre of skim milk powder in a screw capped container to act as the diluent for the vaccine.\r\r\n• Remove the caps and stoppers from the vials.\r\r\n• Using a 5 or 10 mL syringe, dissolve each plug of freeze-dried vaccine with about 2-3 mL of the prepared diluent.\r\r\n• Withdraw the dissolved contents from all of the vials back into the diluent container.\r\r\n• Shake the container well and hold in the refrigerator until ready for use.\r\r\n• Vaccine should be administered as soon as possible after preparation.\r\r\n \r\r\nVaccination Procedure\r\r\nVaccine may be administered to chickens through the drinking water using a medication tank method or by directly dispensing into the drinking fonts. \r\r\n \r\r\nMedication Tank Method\r\r\n• Do not administer any medication or disinfectants in the drinking water within 2 days of vaccination; \r\r\n• Determine the drinking water consumption of the chickens over a two-hour period on the day before vaccination. \r\r\n• On the morning of the day of vaccination, turn off the main water supply and thoroughly clean all drinking fonts. Do not use disinfectants during cleaning. \r\r\n• The medication tank should be emptied and cleaned. Do not use disinfectants during cleaning. \r\r\n• Fill the medication tank with the amount of water that you calculated would last the chickens 2 hours of water consumption. Add skim milk powder at the rate of 2.5 gm/litre and mix this thoroughly with the fresh water in the tank. \r\r\n• Tip the previously prepared vaccine into the tank and again mix thoroughly. \r\r\n• Turn on the medication tank and drain off any clear water until the water containing the skim milk powder and vaccine appears as a cloudy white colour. Allow the drinkers to fill and then encourage all the chickens to consume the vaccine/water.\r\r\n• Continue to encourage consumption of all of the vaccine/water over the next two hours. \r\r\n• Turn on the main water supply only after all of the vaccine mixture has been consumed. \r\r\n\r\r\nDirectly into drinking fonts\r\r\n• As described above, determine the water consumption of the chickens over two hours. \r\r\n• Turn off the main water supply and then clean, rinse and empty the water troughs. \r\r\n• Avoid the use of disinfectants or detergents during cleaning. \r\r\n• Prepare the vaccine in a one-litre volume as described above. \r\r\n• Prepare a larger volume of water (eg in a clean plastic garbage bin) equivalent to the volume of water that the birds will consume over a two-hour period. Add skim milk powder at the rate of 2.5 gm/litre and mix thoroughly. \r\r\n• Mix in the previously prepared vaccine and thoroughly stir the mixture. \r\r\n• Distribute the vaccine mixture with a clean container to all the drinking fonts in the shed. \r\r\n• Encourage the chickens to drink and ensure that the fonts continue to be topped-up until all the vaccine/water is consumed. \r\r\n• The vaccine/water should be consumed in two hours. \r\r\n• Ensure that the chickens only have access to the vaccine/water and not to any other water supplied during this two-hour period.\r\r\n \r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD: NIL\r\r\n \r\r\nUSER SAFETY INFORMATION:\r\r\nIf the vaccine is accidentally splashed into the operator’s eyes, the eyes and face should be thoroughly washed with water to avoid any potential reaction.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\r\r\nStore below -18°C (deep freeze). \r\r\n \r\r\nDISPOSAL:\r\r\n- Discarded unused vaccine and empty vaccine bottles into a disinfectant solution (e.g. chlorine based bleach). Dispose of any such inactivated, unused vaccine and empty containers by wrapping in paper and putting in garbage. \r\r\n- In cases of spillage, soak up the liquid with an absorbent sponge or cloth and incinerate. Treat the surface with a disinfectant solution (e.g. chlorine based bleach). \r\r\n \r\r\nCAUTION:\r\r\nThe capability of this vaccine to produce satisfactory results depends upon many factors, including – but not limited to – conditions of storage and handling by the user, administration of the vaccine, health and responsiveness of individual chickens and degree of field exposure. Therefore, directions for use should be followed carefully.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTACT DETAILS:\r\r\nBIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd \r\r\nACN 007 303 728 \r\r\n36 Charter Street \r\r\nRingwood \r\r\nVictoria 3134, Australia \r\r\nPH: 03 9876 0567\r\r\nFAX: 03 9876 0556 \r\r\n \r\r\nWARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER\r\r\n- Vaxsafe® IBD has been tested and meets safety and potency standards according to the Standards required by the APVMA. \r\r\n- BIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd accepts no responsibility for events arising from the misuse or mishandling of the product. \r\r\n- BIOPROPERTIES Pty Ltd gives no warranty (express or implied) with respect to the product, including without limitation any warranty as to completeness, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

Canine distemper, canine infectious hepatitis, canine parvovirus disease and respiratory disease caused by canine adenovirus type 2 - every 3 years.\r\r\n2. Leptospirosis and respiratory disease caused by canine parainfluenza virus- every year.\r\r\n3. Rabies- every 3 years (can be modified to comply with local regulations).\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nThe contents of one vial of reconstituted vaccine should be injected subcutaneously. \r\r\nReconstitute immediately prior to use by the addition of the contents of one vial (1.0 ml) Nobivac Lepto or Nobivac L4 (canine leptospirosis vaccine), one vial (1.0 ml) Nobivac Rabies, one vial (1.0 ml) Nobivac RL, or one vial (1.0 ml) of Nobivac Solvent. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be used within 30 minutes.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE\r\r\nOnly healthy dogs should be vaccinated and an adequate clinical examination should be made prior to inoculation. Following vaccination, contact with potential sources of canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus and/or canine parvovirus infection should be avoided until 7 days after the inoculation. Sterile equipment should be used for administration, but avoid contamination of vaccine with traces of disinfectant or spirit.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS AND WARNINGS\r\r\nOccasionally a mild anaphylatic type hypersensitivity reaction may occur after vaccination, as is possible with all foreign proteins. Such reactions are, in most cases, self limiting.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE: 24 months.\r\r\nThe reconstituted vaccine shall be used within 30 minutes\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS AND STORAGE\r\r\nVaccine should be stored refrigerated (between +2° and 8°C) and protected from light. Care should be taken to avoid prolonged or repetitive exposure to high temperatures following withdrawal from the refrigerator prior to use; under hot summer conditions vaccine potency can be severely reduced within a few hours. Nobivac Solvent may be stored at room temperature.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRESENTATION\r\r\nBoxes containing vials of Nobivac DHPPi and vials of Nobivac Solvent, or boxes containing only vials of Nobivac DHPPi.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE QUANTITY\r\r\nCartons of 5, 10, 25 or 50 single dose vials.\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\nExperience has shown that the maternal antibody status of pups within a litter varies greatly and reliance should not be placed on serological examination of the bitch alone.

A small transient swelling at the site of injection (≤ 4 cm), which can occasionally be firm and painful on palpation, has been obserced very commonly in clinical studies. Any such swelling will either have disappeared or be clearly diminished by 14 days post-vaccination.\r\r\n- In very rare cases, clinical signs of immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, or immune-mediated polyarthritis have been reported. In very rare cases a transient acute hypersensitivity reaction may occur. Such reactions may evolve to a more severe condition (anaphylaxis), which may be life-threatening. If such reactions occur appropriate treatment is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals treated displaying adverse reaction(s)\r\r\n- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals treated)\r\r\n- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- rare (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nDose & Administration\r\r\nSubcutaneous use.\r\r\nBefore use, ensure that the vaccine is at room temperature (15°C - 25°C).\r\r\nAdministered two vaccinations of 1 dose (1ml) of vaccine with an interval of 4 weeks of dogs from 6 weeks of age onwards.\r\r\n\r\r\nVaccination scheme:\r\r\nBasic vaccination: The first vaccination can be administered from 6 to 9 (*) weeks of age and the second vaccination from 10 to 13 weeks of age.\r\r\nRevaccination: Dogs should be revaccinated annually with one dose (1 ml) of vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\n(*) In case of high level of maternally derived antibodies, first vaccination is recommended at 9 weeks of age).\r\r\n\r\r\nFor simultaneous use, 1 dose of a Nobivac vaccine containing canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parvovirus, and/or canine parainfluenza virus components should be reconstituted with 1 dose (1 ml) of Nobivac L4. The mixed vaccines should be at room temperature (15°C - 25°C) before they are administered by subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdvice on correct administration\r\r\nBefore use, allow the vaccine is at room temperature (15°C- 25°C).\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal period\r\r\nNot applicable\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage precautions\r\r\n- Keep out of sight and reach of children.\r\r\n- Store in refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).\r\r\n- Do not freeze.

In case of ocular irritation seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.\r\r\n\r\r\nUse during pregnancy\r\r\nCan be used during pregnancy.\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\nNone.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions\r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be mixed and administered with vaccines of the Nobivac series containing canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parvovirus and/or canine parainfluenza virus components for subcutaneous administration. The product information of the relevant Nobivac vaccines should be consulted before administration of the mixed product. When mixed with these Nobivac vaccines, the demonstrated safety and efficacy claims for Nobivac L4 are no different from those described for Nobivac L4 alone.\r\r\n- When mixed with Nobivac vaccines containing canine parainfluenza virus at annual revaccination, it has been established that there is no interference with the anamnestic response induced by the injectable canine parainfluenza virus component.\r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be administered on the same day but not mixed with vaccines of the Nobivac series containing Bordetella bronchiseptica and/or parainfluenza virus components for intranasal administration.\r\r\n- No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product except the products mentioned above. A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\nNo adverse reactions other than those mentioned under Adverse reactions were observed after the administration of a double dose of vaccine. However, these reactions may be more severe and/or last longer. For example, local swelling, which can be up to 5 cm in diameter and which may take over 5 weeks to completely disappear, may be observed at the site of injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresentation.\r\r\nPlastic Box with 5, 10, 25 or 50 vials of 1 ml (1 dose).\r\r\n\r\r\nManufactured by:\r\r\nIntervet International B.V.\r\r\nWim de Korverstraat 35\r\r\n5831 AN Boxmeer,\r\r\nThe Netherland\r\r\n\r\r\nImported & Marketed by: \r\r\nIntervet India Pvt Ltd.

        "description": "DESCRIPTION\r\r\nThis vaccine contains an inactivated culture of Rabies virus, cloned out of strain Pasteur RIVM with a potency ≥ 2 I.U. The virus is grown on the BHK-21 clone CT cell line and inactivated with beta – propiolactone. It is presented as an aqueous Aluminium phosphate suspension. Colour of the vaccine may vary from light yellow/ orange to slightly red/purple with a whitish sediment. Thiomersal is used as preservative.\r\r\n\r\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\r\nEach 1 ml dose contains:\r\r\n- Inactivated Rabies strain Pasteur RIVM with potency ≥ 2 I.U.\r\r\n- Preservative: Thiomersal 0.01% w/v\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATION\r\r\nFor the active immunisation of healthy dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, goats, ferrets, foxes and horses (and in principle all healthy mammals) against Rabies. Nobivac Rabies can be used for both prophylactic (pre-exposure) immunisation and for post-bite treatment (post–exposure prophylaxis).\r\r\n\r\r\nNB: Post-bite treatment (post –exposure prophylaxis) should not be used as an alternative, to avoid vaccinating animals prophylactically (pre-exposure). It is recommended that all animals at risk of exposure are vaccinated prophylactically. Post-bite treatment (post–exposure prophylaxis) should be carried out under strict supervision of a registered veterinary practitioner only.\r\r\n\r\r\nVACCINATION SCHEME – PROPHYLAXIS (PRE-EXPOSURE)\r\r\nPrimary vaccination*\r\r\n» Dogs/Cats: 3 months or more (IM or SC)\r\r\n» Cattle/Horses/Sheep/Goats: 6 month or more (IM)\r\r\n» Ferrets: 3 months or more (SC)\r\r\n\r\r\nRevaccination**\r\r\n» Dogs/Cats: every 3 years (IM or SC)\r\r\n» Cattle/Horses/Sheep/Goats: every 2 years (IM)\r\r\n» Ferrets: every 1 years (SC)\r\r\n\r\r\n* Primary vaccination can be administered at an earlier age, but then a repeat vaccination must be given at the age of 3 or 6 months depending on the species.\r\r\n\r\r\n** Recommended revaccination interval is based upon results from challenge experiments. Local regulations in force may require earlier revaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\nResults from serological investigations indicate that vaccination of sheep, goats and foxes provides protection for at least one year.\r\r\n\r\r\nVACCINATION SCHEME – POST-BITE TREATMENT (POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS) In all species, repeated single doses of vaccine should be administered (by the above recommended route) according to the following schedule.\r\r\n\r\r\nDose  Timing\r\r\n1st   Day 0 (as soon as possible following bite/exposure)\r\r\n2nd   Day 3\r\r\n3rd   Day 7\r\r\n4th   Day 14\r\r\n5th   Day 28\r\r\n\r\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\r\nVaccination leads to a high peak of antibody levels within 3 weeks. Whilst post-bite treatment (post exposure prophylaxis) will, if administered promptly, protect the majority of exposed animals from developing Rabies, as with any post infection treatment, it remains possible that disease may still occur in individual cases. It is therefore vitally important that owners are informed about this and that they are advised to monitor their animal closely for any signs of disease for the remainder of the incubation period. Should any suspicious signs appear, the animal should be treated as potentially rabid, and immediate veterinary advice should be sought.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n1 ml subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.\r\r\n• Shake well before use.\r\r\n• Allow the vaccine to reach ambient temperature (15 to 25°C)\r\r\n• Use sterile needle and syringe.\r\r\n\r\r\nNote - Nobivac Rabies can be used to reconstitute the freeze-dried Nobivac canine vaccines and can be administered in combination with Nobivac Lepto.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor 10 dose presentation, broached vials should be used within one working day.\r\r\n\r\r\nVACCINATION REACTIONS\r\r\n- After subcutaneous administration occasionally a transient palpable nodule may occur at the site of injection.\r\r\n- Generalised hypersensitivity reactions following administration may occasionally occur. In this event administration of Adrenaline injection by the subcutaneous route may be indicated.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNITY\r\r\nIn dogs, peak antibody titres have been demonstrated to occur by 3 weeks after vaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD\r\r\nNone.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE: At least 4 years at 2 to 8⁰C.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\nStore in dark between 2°C to 8°C.

For syringes intended to treat horses up to 600 kg and 1100 kg, graduations are indicated at intervals of 100 kg live weight. For syringes intended to treat horses up to 750 kg, graduations are indicated at intervals of 125 kg live weight. The syringe should be adjusted according to the calculated dose by placing the dial in front of the appropriate graduation on the plunger.\r\r\n\r\r\nDirections for use:\r\r\nThe product is for oral administration only. While holding the piston, turn the knob on the piston 1/4 turn to the left and slide it so that the stop ring is at the level of the graduation corresponding to the weight to be treated. Lock the dial in this position by turning it 1/4 turn to the right so that the two arrows, the one on the dial and the one on the piston, align. Make sure that the horse's mouth does not contain any food. Remove the cap from the tip of the syringe. Insert the tip of the syringe into the horse's mouth at the interdental space and place the paste on the base of the tongue. Immediately raise the horse's head for a few seconds after administration and make sure the paste is swallowed.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithdrawal Time\r\r\n- Milk: Do not use on mares whose milk is intended for human consumption.\r\r\n- Meat and offal: 30 Day\r\r\n\r\r\nContraindications\r\r\nThe product has been formulated for use in horses only. The ivermectin content of this product may cause adverse effects in cats, dogs, especially Collies, Bobtails and related and mixed breeds, as well as turtles (aquatic and terrestrial), if they ingest paste spilled on the floor or have access to used syringes.\r\r\n\r\r\nPregnancy, lactation or egg-laying\r\r\n- Studies in laboratory animals with ivermectin and praziquantel have shown no teratogenic or embryotoxic effects at therapeutically recommended doses.\r\r\n- A combination of ivermectin and praziquantel may be administered only after the third month of gestation and during lactation. In the absence of clinical data in the early stages of gestation, the use of the product during the first three months of gestation should only be done after the benefit/risk assessment by the veterinarian.\r\r\n\r\r\nOverdose\r\r\n- No treatment-related adverse reactions were observed in horses aged 2 months treated with the product up to 3 times the recommended dose and in adult horses treated at ten times the recommended dose.\r\r\n- Decreased feed intake, increased body temperature, salivation and decreased vision were observed in horses treated twice with ivermectin oral paste or once with the product, at ten times the recommended dose (i.e. 2 mg/kg body weight). All signs were gone within 5 days.\r\r\n- No antidote has been identified. However, symptomatic treatment may be necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacodynamics\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: anthelmintics, ivermectin, combinations.\r\r\n- The product is an endectocide combining an anthelmintic active ingredient, ivermectin, and a tenicidal active ingredient, praziquantel.\r\r\n- Ivermectin is an endectocide of the macrocyclic lactone family. Compounds in this family bind specifically and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride channels that are present in the nerve and muscle cells of invertebrates. This leads to an increase in membrane permeability to chloride ions, leading to hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell. This results in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds in this family can also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those involving the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid).\r\r\n- The margin of safety assigned to compounds in this family comes from the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels, and macrocyclic lactones do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\r\r\n- Praziquantel is a synthetic pyrazino-isoquinoline derivative, active on several trematode and cestode parasites. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that trematodes and cestodes rapidly absorb praziquantel within minutes. Praziquantel causes tetanic contractions of the parasites' musculature with a rapid vacuolation of their integument, resulting in their detachment from the host. Praziquantel alters the membrane permeability of trematodes and cestodes, which influences the fluxes of bivalent cations, including calcium ion homeostasis. This is considered to contribute to rapid muscle contraction and vacuolization. The margin of safety of praziquantel is due to its rapid metabolism and excretion as well as its selective action on susceptible parasites.\r\r\n\r\r\nPharmacokinetics and environment\r\r\n- Following oral administration of the recommended dose of the drug, praziquantel is absorbed and excreted rapidly in horses, whereas ivermectin is absorbed more slowly and persists longer in the body.\r\r\n- Peak plasma concentrations of praziquantel (in the order of 1 μg/mL) are reached rapidly (approximately within one hour of treatment). The plasma trough level of praziquantel decreases rapidly to become unquantifiable at around 7.5 hours after dosing.\r\r\n- Praziquantel is excreted primarily as metabolites in the urine and faeces within 24 hours, with excreted rates corresponding to 31% and 24% of the administered dose, respectively.\r\r\n- Peak plasma concentrations of ivermectin (Cmax = 37.9 ng/mL) are reached more slowly (Tmax = approximately 9 hours after treatment) and levels become non-detectable/unquantifiable no later than 28 days after dosing.\r\r\n- Fecal excretion is the major process of elimination of ivermectin in all species studied.\r\r\n- No pharmacological interference was noted between ivermectin and praziquantel.\r\r\n\r\r\nRetention period\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 3 years.\r\r\n- After first opening: 2 years.\r\r\n\r\r\nPackaging\r\r\n- White polypropylene oral syringe.\r\r\n- Polypropylene graduated piston with orange polypropylene wheel and rubber tip.\r\r\n- White low-density polyethylene cap (7.74 g syringe).\r\r\n- Orange rubber stopper (9.68 g and 14.19 g syringes).\r\r\n- Colourless polypropylene bag.",

        "description": "COMPOSITION\r\r\nEach 100 ml contains:\r\r\n- Moxidectin  1 gm\r\r\n\r\r\nPROPERTIES\r\r\n- Moxidectin is a parasiticide active against a wide range of internal and external parasites and is a second generation macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin family. Its principal mode of action is interference with neuromuscular transmission of the GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) -gated or glutamate-gated chloride channels.\r\r\n- Moxidectin stimulates the release of GABA and increases its binding to the postsynaptic receptors. The net effect is to open the chloride channels on the postsynaptic junction to allow the inflow of chloride ions and induce an irreversible resting state. These results in flaccid paralysis and eventual death of parasites exposed to the drug.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nsheep.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\n• Gastro-intestinal nematodes: Haemonchus contorted, Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta (including inhibited larvae), Trichostrongylus axei (adults), Trichostrongylus colubriformis (adults and L3), Nematodirus spathiger (adults), Cooperia curticei (adults), Cooperia punctata (adults), Gaigeria pachyscelis (L3), Oesophagostomum columbianum (L3), Chabertia ovina (adults), Respiratory tract nematode: Dictyocaulus filaria (adults).\r\r\n• Larvae of Diptera: Oestrus ovis: L1, L2, L3.\r\r\n• Trials have shown that Moxidectin may be effective against strains of Haemonchus contortus resistant to benzimidazoles, ivermectin and doramectin.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Route: S/C injection in the neck.\r\r\n- For whole product: 0.1 ml of product / 5 Kg.b.wt.\r\r\n\r\r\n• For routine prevention of sheep scab, all sheep in the flock must be injected once.\r\r\n• The curative treatment of scab requires two injections 10 days apart.\r\r\n• The two injections must be given on different sides of the neck.\r\r\n• The first dose should be given at around 4-6 weeks of age to lambs to control worms, with a second dose 6 weeks later, if necessary.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nCare should be taken to avoid the following practices because they increase the risk of development of resistance and could ultimately result in ineffective therapy:\r\r\n• Too frequent and repeated use of anthelmintics from the same class, over an extended period of time.\r\r\n• Under dosing this may be due to underestimation of bodyweight, misadministration of the product, or lack of calibration of the dosing device (if any).\r\r\n• Suspected clinical cases of resistance to anthelmintics should be further investigated using appropriate tests (e.g. Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test). Where the results of the test(s) strongly suggest resistance to a particular anthelmintic, an anthelmintic belonging to another pharmacological class and having a different mode of action should be used.\r\r\n• Resistance to macrocyclic lactones has been reported in Teladorsagia in sheep in a number of countries. In 2008, throughout Europe, moxidectin resistance is very rare; it has been reported in a single case involving a levamisole, benzimidazole and ivermectin-resistant strain of Teladorsagia circumcincta. Therefore the use of moxidectin should be based on local (regional, farm) epidemiological information about susceptibility of nematodes, local history of treatments and recommendations on how to use the product under sustainable conditions to limit further selection for resistance to anthelminitcs. These precautions are especially important when moxidectin is being used to control resistant strains.\r\r\n• A single injection will protect against scab for at least 28 days, but contact with infected sheep after this time may result in infestation. All bought-in or returning animals should be treated and isolated for at least 12 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS\r\r\n• Not to be used in animals vaccinated against footrot.\r\r\n• Not for use in sheep producing milk for human consumption or Industrial purposes, including the dry period.\r\r\n• Dangerous to fish and aquatic life. Do not contaminate ponds, waterways and ditches with the product or used containers.\r\r\n• Don't use products containing benzyl alcohol for newly born pets/ domestic animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nSIDE EFFECTS\r\r\n- The symptoms of overdose are consistent with mode of action of moxidectin and generally do not occur at less than 10 times the recommended dose. They are manifested as transient salivation, depression, drowsiness and ataxia 8 and 12 hours post-treatment.\r\r\n- No treatment is generally necessary. The symptoms resolve in 24 to 48 hours.

Moxidectin interacts with GABA receptors and chloride channels. The net effect is to open the chloride channels on the postsynaptic junction to allow the inflow of chloride ions and induce an irreversible resting state. This results in flaccid paralysis and eventual death of parasites.\r\r\n- Clorsulon is a member of the sulphonamide family. Clorsulon inhibits the glycolytic enzymes 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase, thereby blocking the Emden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway; the fluke is deprived of its main metabolic energy source and dies.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATION\r\r\n- Gastrointestinal roundworm (adult and immature stages of): Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi (including inhibited larvae), Ostertagia lyrata, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus longispicularis, Cooperia mcmasteri (sumabada), Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Nematodirus spathiger (adults only), Nematodirus helvetianus (adults only), Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Oesophagostomum venulosum, Trichuris spp. (adults only).\r\r\n- Lungworm (adult and immature): Dictyocaulus viviparus.\r\r\n- Liver Fluke (adult): Fasciola hepatica.\r\r\n- Cattle Grubs: Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum.\r\r\n- Mites: Chorioptes bovis, Psoroptes ovis (Psoroptes communis var. bovis).\r\r\n- Lice: Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus, Damalinia bovis.\r\r\n- Horn flies: Haematobia irritans.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nCattle.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n• Route of Administration: subcutaneous injection.\r\r\n- Dose of active ingredient: 0.2 mg moxidectin + 2 mg clorsulon / kg.b.w.\r\r\n- Dose of whole product: 1 ml of the product / 50 kg b.w.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Resistance may develop to any anthelmintic.

        "description": "Volvac®ND LaSotaMLV\r\r\nThe vaccine is lyophilized live attenuated vaccine against Newcastle disease virus (Lasota strain).\r\r\n\r\r\nComposition\r\r\nOne dose of the vaccine contains:\r\r\n- live Newcastle disease virus, La Sota strain: at least 10^6 EID50\r\r\n\r\r\nIndications\r\r\nThe vaccine is intended for vaccination and revaccination of clinically healthy birds from one day of age and older (broilers, rearing stock, laying hens and parent poultry) in order to prevent Newcastle disease.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosing and administration\r\r\n- Vaccination and revaccination are intended for clinically healthy birds of any age.\r\r\n- The vaccine is administered by the following methods: drinking, intraocular and spray.\r\r\n- Preparation of the vaccine solution: To maintain maximum effectiveness, it is recommended to mix the vaccine with a solvent (saline) or drinking water before vaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\nPreparation of the vaccine solution according to the instructions.\r\r\n1. Remove the aluminum cap from the vial.\r\r\n2. Carefully remove the rubber stopper from the vial and add solvent or drinking water to the level of the half-filled vial.\r\r\n3. Close the bottle with a rubber stopper. Shake the vial thoroughly until the freeze-dried vaccine is completely dissolved.\r\r\n4. In case of mixing with drinking water, rinse the vial with the vaccine 2-3 times. When mixed with solvent, add the rest of the solvent to the freshly prepared slurry and shake thoroughly again.\r\r\n5. The vaccine solution is now ready for use. Use the prepared vaccine solution within 4 hours after dissolution.\r\r\n\r\r\nIntraocular method:\r\r\n• Connect the dispensing applicator (pipette) to the rubber stopper of the vaccine solution.\r\r\n• Hold the bird in such a way that one eye is up. Apply one drop of vaccine solution (0.03 ml) to the conjunctiva of the eye of each bird. Wait until the drop spreads over the conjunctiva and is completely absorbed.\r\r\n- The vaccine must be dissolved immediately before use. For dilution of 1000 doses of lyophilized vaccine, use 30 ml of solvent, for a vial of 2000 doses - respectively 60 ml of solvent.\r\r\n\r\r\nDrinking method:\r\r\n• Suspend the addition of any medications and disinfectants to drinking water 24 hours before vaccination.\r\r\n• Place a sufficient number of drinkers to vaccinate the entire flock of chickens at the same time.\r\r\n• Clean drinking bowls should be washed exclusively with water, avoiding the use of disinfectants and detergents that may inactivate the virus.\r\r\n• Do not water the bird for 2 hours before vaccination to stimulate thirst and consume the entire volume of the vaccine solution.\r\r\n• Apply the vaccine solution as instructed.\r\r\n• After dissolving the lyophilisate with water, move the vaccine solution to a container with clean, fresh water. Stir well.\r\r\n• It is recommended to use any water stabilizer to prevent the negative effects of water hardness, chlorine and iodine ions, and changes in the pH level.\r\r\n• Add the vaccine to pre-stabilized drinking water for 15 minutes according to the instructions below.\r\r\n\r\r\n- For vaccination by drinking, for example, for 10,000 poultry at the age of 1-4 weeks, 10,000 immunizing doses of vaccine and water stabilizer are added to a container of 100 liters of water (or such a volume of drinking water that can be fully consumed within 2 hours), thoroughly mixed.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Drinking water with vaccine solution should be evenly distributed among the drinkers. Make sure all chickens have drank water with the vaccine solution. Protect the vaccine from direct sunlight.\r\r\n• After consuming the entire vaccine solution in drinking bowls, provide the bird with clean, fresh water.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpray method (large-droplet spraying):\r\r\nDissolve the vaccine in clean, fresh water, free of medications, iron and chlorine ions.\r\r\n\r\r\nUse the following recommendations to prepare the vaccine:\r\r\n• The amount of water used for vaccination with the spray method depends on some factors, namely the age of the chickens, housing conditions, temperature, management and equipment used for vaccination by aerosol. Usually this volume of water ranges from 250 – 500 ml per 1000 doses.\r\r\n\r\r\n• 1000 doses per 0.25 liter for immunization of day-old chicks and 1000 doses per 0.5 liter for immunization of older chicks.\r\r\n• The vaccine solution must be prepared immediately before vaccination.\r\r\n• The sprayer must be free of foreign particles, corrosion, disinfectants and is intended for vaccination only.\r\r\n• Spray the vaccine over the appropriate number of chickens at a distance of 30-40 cm. Make sure that the vaccine is evenly sprayed on the feathers of the bird.\r\r\n• Reduce the intensity of the light.\r\r\n• Turn on the ventilation and lighting system in the room 15-30 minutes after vaccination.",

Sterile needle and syringe should be used for this preparation.\r\r\n- 30 ml of diluent should be used to administer 1,000 doses.\r\r\n- Hold the bird to be vaccinated with the head tilted to one side.\r\r\n- Hold the plastic bottle with the dropper tip down, gently press the sides, dropping one drop of vaccine onto the eye of the bird. Be sure the vaccine spreads over the eye before releasing the bird.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Spray Method\r\r\n- Use sterile distilled water and reconstitute the vaccine as explained in the eye-drop method.\r\r\n- It is preferable to use a sprayer working under constant pressure. Use the right nozzles size (as prescribed by the sprayer manufacturer) and tune the pressure to produce a coarse spray.\r\r\n- Delivery rate varies from 0.2 to 0.3 litres / 1000 day-old chicks in a box and from 0.5 to 1 litre / 1000 birds on litter.

Switch on ventilation and heaters.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Drinking Water Method\r\r\n- Do not use a disinfectant in the drinking water for a period of 48 hours prior to and 24 hours after vaccination.\r\r\n- When a chlorine pump is used, switch it off for the same period of time,\r\r\n- The waterers should be thoroughly cleaned before vaccination. No disinfectant shall be used. Close the water distribution system, raise and empty the nipple lines or empty the waterers. Water withholding period varies according to age of birds and climatic conditions (average 1h 30min)\r\r\nPrepare only the amount of vaccine to be used immediately.\r\r\n- Use only plastic material and tools to prepare and administer vaccine.\r\r\n- Prepare the required volume of water that will be consumed by the birds in 2 hours. This volume may change according to the climatic and environmental conditions.\r\r\n\r\r\nMin, water amount / 1000 birds\r\r\n• 3-4 weeks >>> 25-30 litres\r\r\n• From 10 weeks >>> 40 litres\r\r\n\r\r\n- As an aid in preserving the virus activity, neutralise the chlorine with 2.5 g of skimmed milk powder per litre of water or 15 mg of sodium thiosulfate per litre of water and let stand for 10 minutes.\r\r\n- Do not use water containing high concentrations of metal ions.\r\r\n- Mix the vaccine with clean, cool, non-chlorinated water by opening the vials under the water.\r\r\n- Open the water system when the colour of the water changes (blue dye), lower the lines and check distribution throughout the house. When the tank is empty: fill it with a solution of skimmed milk powder, let it stand for 10 min., then open the water system to flush out the remaining vaccine solution in the pipeworks.\r\r\n- Vaccine solution can be distributed also manually by workers using plastic watering cans.\r\r\n\r\r\nGENERAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Satisfactory protection can be achieved only in healthy birds.\r\r\n- Always round the number of doses up. (e.g. 20,000 doses for 19.450 birds), do not stretch dosage. All the birds in the flock must be vaccinated at the same time.\r\r\n- Administer the vaccine during the coolest time of the day.\r\r\n- Dispose of all opened vaccine containers remaining after vaccination, following the prescriptions of national or local regulations.\r\r\n- Improper storage or handling of the vaccine may result in loss of potency.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNING\r\r\nNewcastle Disease virus may cause a mild inflammation of the eye in humans which lasts for two or three days.

A single vaccination is sufficient to provide protection during the risk period.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nDo not use in birds in lay and breeding birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\nVaccinate only healthy birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n• For use in animals\r\r\n- Apply the usual aseptic precautions to all administration procedures. \r\r\n- As a live vaccine, the vaccine strain is excreted from vaccinated birds and may spread to turkeys. \r\r\n- Safety and reversion to virulence trials have shown that the strain is safe for turkeys. However, precautionary measures have to be followed in order to avoid direct or indirect contact between vaccinated chickens and turkeys.\r\r\n\r\r\n• For the person\r\r\n- Wear protective gloves and spectacles during the ampoule thawing and opening operations. \r\r\n- Open ampoules holding them at arm’s length in order to prevent any risk of injury should an ampoule break.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nDo not use in breeding birds and birds in lay.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\n• For subcutaneous route: \r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be mixed with Merial attenuated vaccines against Marek’s disease Rispens strain.\r\r\n- Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be administered on the same day but not mixed with Merial attenuated vaccines against Newcastle disease and Infectious bronchitis. \r\r\n- No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product except the products mentioned above. A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.\r\r\n\r\r\n• For in ovo route: In the absence of specific studies, no other veterinary medicinal product should be administered concurrently with the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Reconstitution of the vaccine\r\r\n• Wear protective gloves and spectacles during the ampoule thawing and opening operations. \r\r\n• Remove from the liquid nitrogen container only those ampoules which are to be used immediately.\r\r\n• Thaw the contents of the ampoules rapidly by agitation in water at 25°C-30°C. Proceed immediately to next step.\r\r\n• As soon as they are thawed, open ampoules holding them at arm’s length in order to prevent any risk of injury should an ampoule break. \r\r\n• Once the ampoule is opened, draw up the contents into a 5 ml sterile syringe.\r\r\n• Transfer the suspension into the diluent (Do not use if cloudy).\r\r\n• Draw up 2 ml of the contents of the diluent into the syringe. \r\r\n• Rinse the ampoule with these 2 ml and then transfer the rinsing liquid into the diluent. Repeat the rinsing operation once or twice.\r\r\n• Repeat the thawing, opening, transfer and rinsing operations for the appropriate number of ampoules to be reconstituted in the diluent; either 1 ampoule of 1,000 doses of vaccine per 200 ml of diluent (or 1 ampoule of 2,000 doses of vaccine per 400 ml of diluent) for subcutaneous administration, or 4 ampoules of 1,000 doses of vaccine per 200 ml of diluent (or 4 ampoules of 2,000 doses of vaccines per 400 ml of diluent) for in ovo administration. \r\r\n• The diluted vaccine prepared as described is mixed by gentle agitation so as to be ready for use. It should be used immediately after the preparation (all of the diluted vaccine should be used up within one hour). This is why the vaccine suspension should only be prepared as and when required.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Posology\r\r\n• One single injection of 0.2 ml per chicken at the age of one day, by subcutaneous route. \r\r\n• One single injection of 0.05 ml per chicken egg at 18 days of embryonation, by in ovo route.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Method of administration\r\r\n• The vaccine must be administered by subcutaneous route or by in ovo route.\r\r\n• For in ovo administration, an automated egg injection machine can be used. The device should be proven to safely and effectively deliver the appropriate dose. The instructions for use of this device should be strictly followed.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\nZero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- ATCvet code QI01AD15\r\r\n- Live recombinant vaccine against Infectious Bursal Disease and Marek’s Disease.\r\r\n- The vaccine strain is a recombinant Herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) expressing the protective antigen (VP2) of the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) strain Faragher 52/70.\r\r\n- The vaccine induces an active immunity and a serological response against Infectious Bursal Disease \r\r\nand Marek’s Disease in chickens.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\n- Use sterile and antiseptic-free and/or disinfectant-free equipment for injections purposes.\r\r\n- Do not mix with any other veterinary medicinal product except those mentioned in section 4.8 and the diluent supplied for use with the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- Shelf life of the non-reconstituted vaccine: 36 months at –196°C \r\r\n- Shelf life of the reconstituted vaccine: up to 2 hours at a temperature below 25°C. \r\r\n- Shelf life of the diluent in polypropylene bottles: 12 months at a temperature below 30°C. \r\r\n- Shelf life of the diluent in polyvinylchloride bags: 36 months at a temperature below 30°C.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store the vaccine in liquid nitrogen. \r\r\n- Store the reconstituted vaccine at a temperature below 25°C. \r\r\n- Store the diluent below 30°C.

        "description": "This vaccine is recommended for in ovo vaccination of 18 to 19-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. For in ovo vaccination, only healthy embryonated eggs should be used. This vaccine is also recommended for subcutaneous vaccination of healthy one-day-old chickens. It is essential that the chickens be maintained under good environmental conditions and that exposure to disease viruses be reduced as much as possible.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis frozen vaccine contains a Marek’s disease serotype 3 vectored virus, that contains a gene insert from bursal disease and a gene insert from Newcastle disease.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREPARATION OF VACCINE\r\r\nTwo hundred (200) mL of diluent is used for each 1,000 doses of vaccine for subcutaneous injection and for each 4,000 doses of vaccine for in ovo administration.\r\r\n1. Dilute the vaccine only as directed, observing all precautions and warnings for handling.\r\r\n2. Remove from the liquid nitrogen only the ampules that are going to be used immediately. Move quickly, but carefully.\r\r\n3. Place the ampule(s) in a large, clean container of water at 68° to 86°F (20° to 30°C) to thaw ampule quickly. Thaw the entire contents. Gently swirl the ampule to disperse contents. Break ampule at its neck and quickly proceed as described below.\r\r\n4. Use 200 mL of sterile diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to be injected subcutaneously or for each 4,000 doses of vaccine to be administered in ovo. Remove the cover from the diluent container. Draw contents of the ampule into a sterile 10 mL syringe fitted with an 18 to 20 gauge needle. Slowly add the contents of the vaccine ampule to the appropriate volume of diluent. Withdraw a small amount of the diluent, rinse the ampule once and add this to the vaccine-diluent mixture. Mix the contents of the diluent container thoroughly by swirling and inverting the container. Do not shake vigorously.\r\r\n5. Keep the container of diluted vaccine in an ice bath. Use the vaccine-diluent mixture immediately. Agitate as needed to ensure a uniform suspension of the cells.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For in Ovo Administration\r\r\nBefore initiating in ovo vaccination, carefully read and follow the egg injection system operator’s manual. Failure to follow instructions may result in personal injury, embryonic morbidity and mortality.\r\r\n1. Sanitize the egg injection system before and after use.\r\r\n2. Inject a 0.05 mL dose into each embryonated egg.\r\r\n3. Use the entire contents of the vaccine container within one hour after mixing the vaccine with the diluent.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For Subcutaneous Injection\r\r\nIMPORTANT: Sterilize vaccinating equipment by autoclaving a minimum of 15 minutes at 250°F (121°C) or boiling in water for at least 20 minutes. Never allow chemical disinfectants to come in contact with vaccinating equipment.\r\r\n1. Use a sterile automatic syringe with a 20 to 22 gauge 3/8” to 1/2” needle that is set to accurately deliver 0.2 mL per dose. Check the accuracy of delivery several times during the vaccination procedure.\r\r\n2. Inject chickens under the loose skin at the back of the neck (subcutaneously), holding the chicken by the back of the neck just below the head. The loose skin in this area is raised by gently pinching with the thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle beneath the skin in a direction away from the head. Inject 0.2 mL per chicken. Avoid hitting the muscles and bones in the neck.\r\r\n3. Use the entire contents of the vaccine container within one hour after mixing the vaccine with the diluent.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREPARATION OF BLUE DYE\r\r\nBlue dye may be aseptically added to sterile diluent using the following procedures:\r\r\n1. Dye mixing:\r\r\nBag/bottle diluent size:\r\r\n- For 200 mL, 400 mL, 600 mL, 800 mL add 0.5 ml Blue Dye.\r\r\n- For 1200 mL, 1600 mL add 1 ml Blue Dye.\r\r\n- For 2400 mL add 1.5 ml Blue Dye.\r\r\n2. Swab top of rubber stoppers on dye vial and diluent container with alcohol; let dry.\r\r\n3. Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the contents of the vial.\r\r\n4. Inject dye into diluent container and mix well.\r\r\n5. Only Boehringer Ingelheim’s Marek’s disease vaccines may be used with this diluent. Add vaccine according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\r\r\n6. Properly dispose of the dye container and any unused contents at the end of the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate diseased embryonated eggs or birds.\r\r\n- Vaccinate all birds on the premises at one time.\r\r\n- Administer a full dose to each embryonated egg or to each bird.\r\r\n- Avoid stress conditions during and following vaccination.\r\r\n- Do not place chickens in contaminated facilities.\r\r\n- Exposure to disease must be minimized as much as possible.\r\r\n- For use in animals only.\r\r\n- In case of human exposure, contact a physician.\r\r\n- Do not mix with other products, except as specified on the label.\r\r\n- Administer only as recommended.\r\r\n- Use entire contents when first opened.\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n- Penicillin and Streptomycin Sulfate are added as bacteriostatic agents. Contains Amphotericin B as a fungistatic agent.\r\r\n- Inactivate unused contents before disposal.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\n- AMPULES: Store in liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n- LIQUID NITROGEN CONTAINER: Carefully observe all liquid nitrogen precautions including wearing eye protection and gloves. Store in a cool, well-ventilated area. Check liquid nitrogen level daily. Keep container away from incubator intakes and chicken boxes. CAUTION: DO NOT HOLD AMPULE TOWARD FACE WHEN REMOVING FROM A LIQUID NITROGEN CONTAINER. NEVER REFREEZE A VACCINE AMPULE AFTER THAWING.\r\r\n\r\r\nLiquid Nitrogen Precautions\r\r\n- The liquid nitrogen containers and vaccines should be handled only by properly trained personnel.\r\r\n- Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold. Accidental contact with skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite. Protect eyes with goggles or face shield. Wear gloves and long sleeves when removing and handling frozen ampules or when adding liquid nitrogen to the container.\r\r\n- Storage and handling of liquid nitrogen containers should be in a well-ventilated area. Excessive amounts of nitrogen reduce the concentration of oxygen in the air of an unventilated space and can cause asphyxiation. If drowsiness occurs, get fresh air quickly and ventilate the entire area. If a person becomes groggy or loses consciousness while working with liquid nitrogen, get the person to a well-ventilated area immediately. If breathing has stopped, begin artificial respiration. Call a physician immediately.",

The indication is applied only in cases where treatment with other antimicrobial drugs was unsuccessful.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Do not inject intravenously.\r\r\n- Should not be used in animals with a history of hypersensitivity to ceftiofur, other beta-lactam antibiotics or any of the excipients.\r\r\n- Do not use for birds (as well as laying eggs) because of the risk of the spread of antimicrobial resistance to humans.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- Hypersensitivity reactions that are not dose-independent may occur. Allergic reactions (e.g. skin reactions, anaphylaxis) may occur from time to time. If allergic reactions are noticed, treatment should be discontinued.\r\r\n- After use in pigs, some of them developed mild reactions at the injection site, such as a change in the color of muscle fascia or fat, which lasted up to 20 days after the injection.\r\r\n- In cattle, mild inflammatory reactions such as tissue oedema or discoloration of subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle fascia may occur at the injection site. In many animals, these signs disappear within 10 days after the injection, but a slight change in the color of the tissues can persist for up to 28 days or more.\r\r\n- If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, it is necessary to inform the veterinarian.\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\n- Cattle.\r\r\n- Pigs weighing up to 125 kg.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGES AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Pigs:\r\r\n- In the case of bacterial respiratory disease: intramuscularly inject ceftiofur 3 mg per 1 kg of body weight per day for 3 days, i.e. 1 ml/16 kg body weight per injection.\r\r\n- The maximum amount of the drug injected into one injection site can not exceed 4 ml. Each time, inject into a different injection site. This drug is not used for pigs with a body weight of more than 125 kg. \r\r\n\r\r\n» Cattle:\r\r\n- In the case of bacterial respiratory disease: subcutaneously inject ceftiofur 1 mg of ceftiofur per 1 kg of body weight per day for 3 to 5 days, i.e. 1 ml/50 kg body weight per injection.\r\r\n- In the case of acute metritis occurring within 10 days of calving: subcutaneously inject 1 mg/kg body weight/day for 5 consecutive days, i.e. 1 ml/50 kg body weight per injection.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Before use, shake the bottle well so that the suspension becomes homogeneous.\r\r\n- In some cases of acute metritis after calving, additional supportive therapy may be required.

Dexamethasone has a marked glucogenic action.\r\r\n(3) Inflammatory conditions in all species: the product will suppress inflammation and is indicated in the treatment of arthritis, laminitis, dermatitis etc.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\nSystemic corticosteroid therapy is generally contra-indicated in patients with renal disease and diabetes mellitus.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS FOR SPECIES\r\r\nUse of the product in horses could induce laminitis and therefore careful observations should be made during treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nFor animals: Anti-inflammatory corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, are known to exert a wide range of side-effects. Whilst single high doses are generally well tolerated, they may induce severe side-effects in long term use and when esters possessing a long duration of action are administered. Dosage in medium to long term use should therefore generally be kept to the minimum necessary to control symptoms.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor the person\r\r\n- This product contains dexamethasone which can cause allergic reactions in some people. People with known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n- In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the carton to the physician. \r\r\n- Pregnant women should not handle this veterinary medicinal product. \r\r\n- Wash hands after use.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n• Steroids themselves, during treatment, may cause Cushingoid symptoms involving significant alteration of fat, carbohydrate, protein and mineral metabolism e.g. redistribution of body fat, muscle weakness and wastage and osteoporosis may result. During therapy effective doses suppress the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. Following cessation of treatment, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency extending to adrenocortical atrophy can arise and this may render the animal unable to deal adequately with stressful situations. Consideration should therefore be given to means of minimising problems of adrenal insufficiency following the withdrawal of treatment, e.g. a gradual reductions of dosage (for further discussion see standard texts).\r\r\n• Systemically, acting corticosteroids may cause polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia, particularly during the early stages of therapy. Some corticosteroids may cause sodium and water retention and hypokalaemia in long term use.\r\r\n• Systemic corticosteroids have caused deposition of calcium in the skin (calcinosis cutis). Corticosteroids may delay wound healing and the immunosuppressant actions may weaken resistance to or exacerbate existing infections.\r\r\n• Gastrointestinal ulceration has been reported in animals treated with corticosteroids and gastrointestinal ulceration may be exacerbated by steroids in patients given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and in corticosteroid treated animals with spinal cord trauma. Steroids may cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) with increased serum hepatic enzymes.\r\r\n• In very rare cases, hypersensitivity reactions might occur.\r\r\n• The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention:\r\r\n- very common (more than 1 in 10 animals treated displaying adverse reaction(s)) \r\r\n- common (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 100 animals treated)\r\r\n- uncommon (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 1,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- rare (more than 1 but less than 10 animals in 10,000 animals treated)\r\r\n- very rare (less than 1 animal in 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports).\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\n- Corticosteroids are not recommended for use in pregnant animals. \r\r\n- Administration in early pregnancy is known to have caused foetal abnormalities in laboratory animals. Administration in late pregnancy may cause early parturition or abortion.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nIn the presence of bacterial infection, antibacterial drug cover is usually required when steroids are used. In the presence of viral infections, steroids may worsen or hasten the progress of the disease.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- By intravenous or intramuscular injection.\r\r\n- Normal aseptic precautions should be observed.\r\r\n\r\r\nRecommended Dosage Schedule:\r\r\n- Horses and cattle: 1 ml per 25 kg bodyweight\r\r\n- Dogs and cats: 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight\r\r\n\r\r\n- Horses 500 kg - 20 ml\r\r\n- Cattle 400 kg - 16 ml\r\r\n- Dogs 10 kg - 1 ml\r\r\n- Cats 5 kg - 0.5 ml\r\r\n\r\r\nTo ensure accuracy of dosing, a suitably graduated syringe must be used when treating small animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nExacerbation of effects described in 4.6 above. No treatment specified.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\n- Cattle (meat): 21 days.\r\r\n- Cattle (milk): 84 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\n- Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.\r\r\n- Treated horses may never be slaughtered for human consumption.\r\r\n- The horse must have been declared as not intended for human consumption under national horse passport legislation.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use, plain; Glucocorticoids\r\r\n- ATC Vet Code: QH02AB02\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\r\r\nDexamethasone is a potent synthetic glucocorticoid which is 30-35 times as potent as cortisol as an anti-inflammatory agent. The mechanism by which corticosteroids exert their effect at the cellular level remains unclear however several mechanisms have been proposed. There is evidence that corticosteroids are able to de-repress transcription of DNA to mRNA in the target cell nucleus. Other mechanisms proposed for the action of corticosteroids include boosting of cellular levels of cyclic AMP made possible by steroid inhibition of phosphodiesterases which would otherwise metabolise cyclic AMP. Some of the anti-inflammatory activity of corticosteroids could be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by suppression of the release of arachidonate, the prostaglandin precursor, from cell membranes.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years \r\r\n- After first opening: 28 days\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Do not store above 25°C.\r\r\n- Following withdrawal of the first dose, use the product within 28 days.\r\r\n- Discard unused material.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n50 ml Amber Type II glass vials sealed with bromobutyl rubber bungs with aluminium overseals.\r\r\n\r\r\nDISPOSAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nAny unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\r\r\n\r\r\nMARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER\r\r\nNorbrook Laboratories Limited\r\r\nStation Works, Camlough Road\r\r\nNewry, Co.

It is recommended for subcutaneous injection of chickens at one day of age or in ovo vaccination of 18- to 19-day-old, embryonated chicken eggs using the Embrex® Inovoject System. It is essential that the birds be maintained under good environmental conditions and that exposure to disease viruses be reduced as much as possible. Bursaplex is a virus-antibody complex vaccine that contains a live strain of bursal disease virus of chicken embryo origin in conjunction with bursal disease antiserum.\r\r\n\r\r\nCautions\r\r\n- Use only in localities where permitted.\r\r\n- Use only in flocks with a history of infectious bursal disease.\r\r\n- This vaccine may be combined only with Zoetis Inc.'s Marek's Disease Vaccine, Serotypes 2 and 3, Live Virus.\r\r\n- Keep out of reach of children.\r\r\n\r\r\nRehydration of vaccine\r\r\n- Dilute the vaccine only as directed, while observing aseptic technique and precautions for safe handling.\r\r\n- For each 1,000 doses of vaccine to be administered by subcutaneous injection, use 200 mL of sterile diluent.\r\r\n- For each 4,000 doses of vaccine to be administered in ovo, at 0.05 mL/egg (50 u/egg), use 200 mL of sterile diluent.\r\r\n- Using a 20-mL sterile syringe and an 18-gauge x 1.5-inch needle, rehydrate only the vials of vaccine that are to be used immediately.\r\r\n- Aseptically transfer enough diluent to the vial containing the lyophilized virus to fill it about three-quarters full. Shake the contents gently until the vaccine is evenly suspended.\r\r\n- Aseptically remove the virus suspension from the vial and combine into the remaining diluent. Thoroughly mix the vaccine and diluent by massaging and inverting. Use immediately.\r\r\n\r\r\n» In Ovo Administration\r\r\nBefore initiating in ovo vaccination, carefully read and follow the Embrex Inovoject System operator's manual. Failure to follow instructions may result in personal injury and embryonic morbidity/mortality. Only healthy embryonated eggs should be vaccinated.\r\r\n1. Sanitize the Embrex Inovoject System before and after use.\r\r\n2. Inject a 0.05-mL dose into each embryonated egg.\r\r\n3. Use the entire contents of the vaccine container within one hour after mixing.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Subcutaneous Administration\r\r\nImportant: Sterilize vaccinating equipment by autoclaving 15 minutes at 121°C or by boiling in water for 20 minutes. Never allow any chemical disinfectant to come in contact with vaccinating equipment.\r\r\n1. Use a sterile automatic syringe with a 20-22 gauge, 3/8-1/2\" needle, set to accurately deliver 0.2 mL. Check accuracy of delivery several times throughout vaccination.\r\r\n2. Hold the chicken by the back of the neck, just below the head. The skin in this area is raised by gently pinching with the thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle beneath the skin directing it away from the head. Inject 0.2 mL. per chick and avoid hitting muscles and bones in the neck.\r\r\n3. Use entire contents of the vaccine within one hour of mixing.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions\r\r\n- Store at 2°-7°C (35°-45°F). Do not freeze.\r\r\n- Use entire contents when first opened.\r\r\n- Burn containers and all unused contents.\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n- Contains gentamicin as preservative.\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate diseased embryonated eggs or birds.\r\r\n- Administer a full dose to each embryonated egg or to each bird.\r\r\n- Exposure to disease must be minimized as much as possible.\r\r\n- For veterinary use only.\r\r\n\r\r\nNotice: Bursaplex has met the regulations of the USDA in regard to safety, purity, potency, and the capability to protect normally susceptible chickens. This vaccine has been tested by the Master Seed immunogenicity test for efficacy.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe ability of this vaccine to produce satisfactory results may depend on many factors, including but not limited to conditions of storage and handling by the user; administration of the vaccine; health and responsiveness of individual chickens; and the degree of exposure. Therefore, directions for use should be followed carefully. The use of this vaccine is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis vaccine in non-returnable\r\r\n\r\r\nU.S. Veterinary license No. 190\r\r\n\r\r\nZoetis Inc.\r\r\nKalamazoo, MI 49007, USA",

The optimum time and method of administration and re-vaccination depends largely upon the local situation. Therefore, the advice of a veterinary surgeon should be sought.\r\r\n\r\r\nDosage\r\r\nOne dose per bird.\r\r\n\r\r\nMethod of administration\r\r\nThe vaccine can be administered by spray, by ocular or nasal instillation or through the drinking water.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Spray method\r\r\nThe vaccine should be dissolved in cool, clean water which is free of iron and chlorine. The vials should be opened under water. The spray apparatus should be free from sediments, corrosion and traces of disinfectants (preferably used for vaccination purpose only). The vaccine medicated water should be sprayed evenly over the correct number of birds, at a distance of 30 to 40 cm, preferably when the birds are sitting together in dim light. For day old chicks use 0.25 liter for 1000 birds and for older birds use 0.5 liter for 1000 birds and set the nozzle to produce a coarse spray.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Intranasal / intraocular instillation\r\r\n- Dissolve the vaccine in physiological saline solution (usually 30 ml per 1000 doses) and administer by means of a standardised dropper. One drop should be applied from a height of a few centimetres into one nostril or one eye. The handler should ensure that the nasal drop is inhaled by the bird.\r\r\n- Note: For intranasal / intraocular administration a special diluent, Diluent Oculo Nasal is available.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Drinking water\r\r\n- The vials should be opened under water. Use cool, clean water which is free of iron and chlorine. By adding 2 gm skimmed milk powder per litre of water the virus retains its activity much longer. Ensure uptake of all the vaccine-medicated water in 2 hours. Depending on the weather conditions, it may be advisable to deprive the birds of water prior to vaccination. A sufficient number of water containers to provide adequate drinking space is essential. These should be clean and free from traces of detergents and disinfectants. Dissolve 1000 doses in as many litres of water as the age of the birds in days, to a maximum of 40 litres. The vaccine should be given in the early morning as this is the main period for drinking or the cool period on a hot day. When vaccinating larger flocks, it is advisable to start by dissolving only part of the vaccine. If vaccine is administered through a central water supply or a proportioner, great care should be taken. For numbers of birds between standard dosages, the next higher dosage should be chosen.\r\r\n- Note: Administration by coarse spray or the oculo-nasal route gives the best response. These should be the methods of choice, especially when vaccinating young birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nWithholding period\r\r\nNone\r\r\n\r\r\nPresentation\r\r\nVials of 1000, 2500 or 5000 doses in packs of 10 vials.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage\r\r\nStore at a temperature of 2-8°C in the dark.\r\r\n\r\r\nContra-indications\r\r\nWhen used according to instructions: None.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther information\r\r\n- Reconstituted vaccine should be used within two hours.\r\r\n- Use of the vaccine can cause temporary conjunctivitis in the operator.\r\r\n- Avoid exposure to the vaccine virus as much as possible (e.g. by wearing a face mask).\r\r\n- The vaccine viruses spread readily to contact chickens.\r\r\n- Dispose of empty or part-used vials in accordance with local regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nPrecautions\r\r\n- Vaccinate healthy birds only.\r\r\n- Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccinating.\r\r\n- Each vial should be used immediately after opening.\r\r\n- Avoid human exposure to vaccine virus as much as possible.",

Reversion to virulence trials carried out in the laboratory have shown that the strain does not revert to virulence neither in chickens nor in turkeys. However, precautionary measures have to be followed in order to diminish the spread.\r\r\n- It is advised not to vaccinate in the presence of other sensitive species (guinea fowl, pheasant), taking into account the spread of the vaccine strain and the lack of safety data for these species.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor the person:\r\r\n- Care should be taken during reconstitution and administration of the vaccine.\r\r\n- Wash hands and wear disposable gloves during reconstitution and administration of the vaccine.\r\r\n- Hands should be washed and disinfected after vaccinating.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\n- None known.\r\r\n- In layer and breeder pullets, refer to the SPC of the inactivated booster vaccine.\r\r\n- Reporting adverse events is important. It allows continuous safety monitoring of a veterinary medicinal product. Reports should be sent, preferably via a veterinarian, to either the marketing authorisation holder or the national competent authority via the national reporting system. See also the last section of the package leaflet for respective contact details.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nLaying birds: Do not use in birds in lay.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\r\nSafety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that the simultaneous use of the vaccine and Infectious Bursal Disease, Infectious Bronchitis and Newcastle Disease vaccines may slightly decrease or transiently delay the humoral response of animals to NEMOVAC. The simultaneous use of the vaccine and Infectious Bronchitis vaccine may decrease and/or delay the Infectious Bronchitis seroconversion. Therefore, no other vaccine should be used simultaneously with the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Broiler chickens: One dose of vaccine to be administered between 7 and 14 days of age when levels of maternally derived antibodies are low, or at 14 days of age when levels of maternally derived antibodies are likely to be high.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Breeder/layer pullets:\r\r\n- One dose of vaccine to be administered at 14 weeks of age before booster vaccination with inactivated vaccine prior to the onset of lay.\r\r\n- Apply the usual aseptic precautions to all administration procedures.\r\r\n- Calculate the number of vials of vaccine required to vaccinate all the birds. Treat all water to come into contact with the vaccine with skimmed milk powder at a rate of 2.5g per litre (Use only clean, antiseptic and disinfectant free drinking water).\r\r\n- Half fill a plastic (non-metallic) container in which a vaccine vial can be submerged with the clean treated drinking water.\r\r\n- Remove the metal caps from each of the vaccine bottles, submerge each one individually and remove the rubber cap. Rinse the bottle, remove the cap and bottle and discard appropriately. Repeat for each bottle.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration by oral route (broilers and pullets): For 1,000 birds, reconstitute the freeze-dried pellet corresponding to 1,000 doses in a small quantity of non-chlorinated drinking water and subsequently dilute it into a volume of non-chlorinated drinking water to be consumed within 1 to 2 hours. Birds may have drinking water withdrawn for 1-2 hours before administering vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration by spray route (pullets):\r\r\n- For 1,000 birds, reconstitute the freeze-dried pellet corresponding to 1,000 doses into 1 \r\r\nml of non-chlorinated water and subsequently dilute it into the volume of non-chlorinated water according to the type of sprayer used (pressure-sprayer or sprayer \r\r\nwith rotary cone, for further information on sprayer equipment, contact the manufacturer).\r\r\n- Spray the vaccine solution above the birds using a sprayer capable of producing \r\r\ndroplets with a mean diameter of 80-150 µm.\r\r\n- For proper vaccine distribution, make sure that birds are evenly distributed during \r\r\nspraying.\r\r\n- The ventilation system of the poultry house should be inoperative during the spray \r\r\nadministration.\r\r\n\r\r\nNote: The reconstituted product appears as a pale suspension.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nNone known.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\nZero days\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmaceutical group: Immunologicals for aves, Live viral vaccines for domestic fowl, avian rhinotracheitis virus.\r\r\n- ATCvet code: QI01AD01.\r\r\n- The vaccine stimulates active immunity of broilers chicken against avian pneumovirus infection (Swollen Head Syndrome).\r\r\n- The vaccine stimulates active immunity of breeder and layer pullets against avian pneumovirus infection (Swollen Head Syndrome), when used as a primer before booster vaccination with an inactivated vaccine containing pneumovirus.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nOnly disinfectant-free and/or antiseptic-free water should be used for the preparation of vaccine solution.

Chickens over 4 days of age can be vaccinated via the drinking water method.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Chickens 1 to 5 days of age\r\r\n• 1st Vaccination: Eyedrop, spray or intranasal methods from day old. Water vaccination from 4 days or older.\r\r\n• 2nd Vaccination: 3 weeks later usually by water but eyedrop or intranasal routes can be used.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Other age groups\r\r\nTwo vaccinations three weeks apart using the drinking water method are recommended, but other methods may be employed. Replacement birds should be revaccinated at 14-16 weeks of age by the most appropriate method.\r\r\n\r\r\nRevaccination\r\r\nDrinking water vaccination, but other methods may be employed.\r\r\n\r\r\nADMINISTRATION METHODS\r\r\nEye drop method\r\r\n- Reconstitution Reconstitute the vaccine with Poulvac® Eye Drop Diluent. Poulvac® Eye Drop Diluent is supplied in a plastic bottle which becomes the dropper bottle when the provided dropper cap is fitted.\r\r\n- Hold the bird with one eye upward and,using the dropper bottle allow one drop to fall onto the eye. Make sure the drop of vaccine spreads over the surface of the eye before releasing the bird.\r\r\n\r\r\nIntranasal method\r\r\n- Prepare the vaccine as for the eyedrop method.\r\r\n- Place a finger over one nostril of the bird and holding the beak closed allow one drop of vaccine to fall into the other nostril.\r\r\n\r\r\nDrinking water method\r\r\n- Administration of the vaccine in the drinking water can be achieved either by using the medication tank method or by direct dispensing into the drinkers. Good husbandry and careful technique are required for good results.\r\r\n- Prepare the diluent by mixing 2.5 g of dried skim milk in 1 litre of clean water. Rainwater should be used when available.\r\r\n- Reconstitute the vaccine by injecting 1.5 mL of the prepared diluent into the vaccine vial in the same manner as described in 3 and 4 under eyedrop method.\r\r\n- Remove the resuspended vaccine from the vial with a syringe and mix it into the diluent previously prepared. Stir thoroughly with a clean paddle.\r\r\n- Pour the mixed vaccine into the final volume of water and skim milk that has been calculated on the flock consumption of water over 2 hours.\r\r\n- Vaccination delivery may be via drinking water lines or direct dispensing to drinkers.\r\r\n- Early morning administration is recommended.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpray method\r\r\n- Remove seal from vial of vaccine.\r\r\n- Remove the stopper and half-fill vial with cool, sterile distilled water.\r\r\n- Replace stopper and shake, until vaccine is in solution\r\r\n- Pour rehydrated vaccine into a clean container and add cool, sterile distilled water to dilute the vaccine as indicated for your specific coarse spray vaccination machine.\r\r\n- For example, with a machine that dispenses 10 mL to a box of 100 chickens, use a total of 500 mL of cool, sterile distilled water per 5,000 doses of vaccine or 1 litre of cool, sterile distilled water per 10,000 doses of vaccine. Shake thoroughly.\r\r\n- The vaccine is now ready for immediate use.\r\r\n- Sanitise the sprayer system in accordance with the procedures described in the operator’s manual.\r\r\n\r\r\nNote:\r\r\nSpray equipment may be checked for distribution of the vaccine and droplet size using a blue dye and an empty box lined with white paper.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS\r\r\n- Use of this vaccine may be restricted in your State or Territory. Contact your local Department of Agriculture (or similar) for details. \r\r\n- Please note that management conditions must be satisfactory if Newcastle Disease vaccination by drinking water method is to be successful.\r\r\n\r\r\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- When handling Newcastle Disease vaccines care should be taken to avoid eye splash or exposure of the eyes or nasal passages of the operator to aerosols.\r\r\n- All containers for mixing the vaccine must be clean and free of disinfectant.\r\r\n- No drugs or disinfectants should be used in the drinking system for 48 hours before vaccination.\r\r\n- Skim milk powder, when used as recommended, acts as a stabiliser and protects the live virus in the vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n- Store at -20°C (freeze).\r\r\n- Protect from light.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD\r\r\nZero (0) days\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGING\r\r\n- Glass vials – 5,000 ds each\r\r\n- Packed in tray of 10 (50,000 ds total)",

Vaccinate healthy 1-day-old chicks only.\r\r\n2. Avoid early exposure of chicks to Marek’s disease virus challenge.\r\r\n3. Use Zoetis Inc. diluent only. Store diluent at not over 27° C (80° F).\r\r\n4. Wear protective clothing when withdrawing vaccine from liquid-nitrogen tank; protect hands with gloves, wear long sleeves, and use a face mask or goggles.\r\r\n5. Before opening liquid-nitrogen tank, prepare a clean, wide-mouthed container with a capacity of 1 to 5 gallons (3.8 to 19 L). Fill half of this container with water at 27° C (80° F).\r\r\n6. When withdrawing a cane of vials from the liquid-nitrogen tank, expose only the vial to be used immediately. When removing a vial from the cane, hold palm of gloved hand away from face and body. Dilute only one vial at a time. Immediately replace cane with remaining vials into the canister in the liquid-nitrogen tank.\r\r\n7. Place the vial into prepared container half-filled with water at 27° C (80° F). The frozen material thaws rapidly. When thawed, towel-dry vial.\r\r\n8. The vials are prescored below the gold band. Before snapping off the top portion, wrap vial with a cloth, holding the top part away from face and body.\r\r\n9. For subcutaneous route of vaccination, use 400 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 800 mL diluent per 4,000 doses. Using a sterile mixing syringe with a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) long, 18-gauge needle, draw up a small volume of diluent. Then draw the contents from the vaccine vial into the syringe and swirl gently. Insert needle into diluent container and slowly expel contents of syringe. Mix well by gently swirling the bottle. Withdraw a small amount of the reconstituted vaccine and use it to rinse each vial, injecting the rinses back into the reconstituted vaccine. The vaccine is ready for use.\r\r\n10. While vaccinating, maintain the diluted vaccine at 21° C to 27° C (70° F to 80° F). If the temperature cannot be held as low as 27° C (80° F), place the diluent bottle containing the diluted vaccine in an ice bath.\r\r\n11. For vaccination, an automatic syringe with 22- to 20-gauge needles, 3/8- to 1/2-inch (0.95 to 1.27 cm) long, is recommended. Make certain that all equipment is sterilized and change needles frequently.\r\r\n12. Inject each chick subcutaneously with 0.2 mL of the vaccine.\r\r\n13. After diluting, use the vaccine within two hours. Do not save any vaccine that has been diluted. Inactivate all unused contents before disposal. Dispose of all materials in a proper manner.\r\r\n\r\r\n» In-ovo Route\r\r\n1. Vaccinate using the in ovo route of vaccination in 18- to 19-day-old healthy embryonated chicken eggs only.\r\r\n2. Use Zoetis Inc. diluent only. Store diluent at or below 27° C (80° F).\r\r\n3. Sanitize the in ovo vaccination equipment in accordance with the procedures described in the in ovo vaccination equipment operators manual.\r\r\n4. Wear protective clothing when withdrawing vaccine from liquid-nitrogen tank; protect hands with gloves, wear long sleeves, and use a face mask or goggles.\r\r\n5. Before opening liquid-nitrogen tank, prepare a clean wide-mouthed container with a capacity of 1 to 5 gallons (3.8 to 19 L). Fill half of this container with water at 27° C (80° F).\r\r\n6. When withdrawing a cane of vials from the liquid-nitrogen tank, expose only the vials to be used immediately. When removing a vial from the cane, hold palm of gloved hand away from face and body. Dilute only five vials at a time.\r\r\n7. Place the vials into a prepared container half-filled with water at 27° C (80° F). The frozen material thaws rapidly. When thawed, towel-dry vial.\r\r\n8. The vials are prescored below the gold band. Before snapping off the top portion, wrap the vial with a cloth, holding the top part away from face and body.\r\r\n9. For in ovo route of vaccination, use 100 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 200 mL diluent per 4,000 doses.\r\r\n10. Using five sterile mixing syringes with a 1 %-inch (3.8 cm) long, 18-gauge needle, draw up a small amount of diluent into each syringe. Then draw the contents from one vaccine vial into the syringe and swirl gently. Insert needle into diluent container and slowly expel contents of syringe. Repeat the previous two steps with the other four syringes. Mix well by gently swirling the container. Withdraw a small amount of the reconstituted vaccine and use it to rinse each vial, injecting the rinses back into the reconstituted vaccine. The vaccine is ready for use.\r\r\n11. While vaccinating, maintain the diluted vaccine (in the diluent container) at 21° C to 27° C (70° F to 80° F). If the temperature cannot be held as low as 27° C (80° F), place the diluent container containing the diluted vaccine in an ice bath.\r\r\n12. Carefully read and follow the in ovo vaccination equipment operators manual before initiating vaccination. Failure to follow instructions for in ovo vaccination equipment operation may result in personal injury and/or embryonic morbidity and mortality.\r\r\n13.

Store diluent at not over 80° F (27° C).\r\r\n• Always wear a face mask and insulated gloves when checking liquid nitrogen levels or handling vaccine from the liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n• Ampules can explode due to a sudden change in temperature. Pull the cane out of the liquid nitrogen container only as far as needed to reach the first ampule.\r\r\n• Wash the thaw bath with soap and water, dry it and spray with alcohol daily.\r\r\n• Fill the water bath with distilled water and keep the water temperature at 80° F or 27° C (#/- 1°).\r\r\n• Add chlorine to the thaw bath water for a final concentration of 200 ppm (15 mL of 5% bleach or sodium hypochlorite per gallon of water; 4 mL per liter of water).\r\r\n• Thaw the vaccine for 70 to 90 seconds. Thawing time begins when the ampule is taken out of the liquid nitrogen.\r\r\n• Thaw no more than four ampules at a time. Total time from thawing to addition to the diluent should be no more than 150 seconds. Immediately after thawing and before opening ampoule, dry hands and ampule with a clean paper towel. Use a new paper towel for each thawing sequence (four or fewer ampules).\r\r\n• Point the top of the ampule away from the face and body and carefully break the ampule at the neck.\r\r\n• Do not spill the contents of the ampule. Wipe the diluent bag port with alcohol and allow the surface to dry for five seconds.\r\r\n• For subcutaneous route of vaccination, use 400 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 800 mL diluent per 4,000 doses.\r\r\n• For in ovo route of vaccination, use 100 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 200 mL diluent per 4,000 doses.\r\r\n• Using a sterile 20 mL syringe with an 18G x 1.5-inch-long needle, draw 5 mL of diluent.\r\r\n• Slowly (three seconds) draw the entire content of the ampule into the syringe. Note: The vaccine is cell associated. Fast drawing or injecting the vaccine could cause cell damage and reduce the potency of the vaccine.\r\r\n• Using an ampule holder is recommended. The ampule holder improves safety by decreasing the risk of self-injection, provides a more stable platform to draw the vaccine and prevents heat transfer from the hand to the ampule.\r\r\n• Slowly (three seconds) add the contents of the syringe to the bag of diluent.\r\r\n• Draw a small amount of diluent, rinse the ampule once and add to the vaccine diluent mixture. Note: Do not touch the outside of the ampule or other unclean surfaces with the needle. If this occurs, it is better to discard the rinse than to potentially contaminate the bag of ready-to-use vaccine.\r\r\n• Write the time the vaccine was added on each bag with a dark-colored marker. Mix the contents of the bag thoroughly by gently massaging and inverting the bag about 10 times.\r\r\n• Do not shake vigorously and avoid creating bubbles. After mixing, chill the vaccine using clean, plastic-covered ice packs.\r\r\n• Transport the vaccine to the vaccination device in a small cooler.\r\r\n• Dry the outside of the bag thoroughly with a new and clean paper towel before hanging.\r\r\n• Use aseptic technique to attach the bag to the vaccination device.\r\r\n• For Embrex® Inovoject®, place the vaccine bag in the Intertherm bag with ice packs to provide ongoing chilling during use.\r\r\n\r\r\nIN OVO METHOD\r\r\n1. Vaccinate using the jn ovo route of vaccination in 18- to 19-day-old healthy embryonated chicken eggs only.\r\r\n2.

Duration of immunity against infectious bursal disease and Newcastle disease is at least 63 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nAVAILABLE AS\r\r\nIn ovo or subcutaneous vaccine\r\r\n\r\r\nTARGET SPECIES\r\r\nChickens\r\r\n\r\r\nPREPARATION OF VACCINE\r\r\n• Use Zoetis Inc. diluent only. Store diluent at not over 27° C (80° F).\r\r\n• Always wear a face mask and insulated gloves when checking liquid nitrogen levels or handling vaccine from the liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n• Ampules can explode due to a sudden change in temperature. Pull the cane out of the liquid nitrogen container only as far as needed to reach the first ampule.\r\r\n• Wash the thaw bath with soap and water, dry it and spray with alcohol daily.\r\r\n• Fill the water bath with distilled water and keep the water temperature at 80° F (+/- 2°) or 27° C (+/- 1°)\r\r\n• Add chlorine to the thaw bath water for a final concentration of 200 ppm (15 mL of 5% bleach or sodium hypochlorite per gallon of water; 4 mL per liter of water).\r\r\n• Thaw the vaccine for 70 to 90 seconds. Thawing time begins when the ampule is taken out of the liquid nitrogen.\r\r\n• Thaw no more than four ampules at a time. Total time from thawing to addition to the diluent should be no more than 150 seconds. Immediately after thawing and before opening ampule, dry hands and ampule with a clean paper towel. Use a new paper towel for each thawing sequence (four or fewer ampules).\r\r\n• Point the top of the ampule away from the face and body and carefully break the ampule at the neck.\r\r\n• Do not spill the contents of the ampule. Wipe the diluent bag port with alcohol and allow the surface to dry for five seconds.\r\r\n• For in ovo route of vaccination, use 100 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 200 mL diluent per 4,000 doses.\r\r\n• For subcutaneous route of vaccination, use 400 mL diluent per 2,000 doses of vaccine; use 800 mL diluent per 4,000 doses.\r\r\n• Using a sterile 20 mL syringe with an 18G x 1.5-inch long needle, draw 5 mL of diluent.\r\r\n• Slowly (three seconds) draw the entire contents of the ampule into the syringe. Note: The vaccine is cell associated. Fast drawing or injecting the vaccine could cause cell damage and reduce the potency of the vaccine.\r\r\n• Using an ampule holder is recommended. The ampule holder improves safety by decreasing the risk of self-injection, provides a more stable platform to draw the vaccine and prevents heat transfer from the hand to the ampule.\r\r\n• Slowly (three seconds) add the contents of the syringe to the bag of diluent.\r\r\n• Draw a small amount of diluent, rinse the ampule once and add to the vaccine diluent mixture. Note: Do not touch the outside of the ampule or other unclean surfaces with the needle. If this occurs, it is better to discard the rinse than to potentially contaminate the bag of ready-to-use vaccine.\r\r\n• Write the time the vaccine was added on each bag with a dark-colored marker. Mix the contents of the bag thoroughly by gently massaging and inverting the bag about 10 times.\r\r\n• Do not shake vigorously and avoid creating bubbles. After mixing, chill the vaccine using clean, plastic-covered ice packs.\r\r\n• Transport the vaccine to the vaccination device in a small cooler.\r\r\n• Dry the outside of the bag thoroughly with a new and clean paper towel before hanging.\r\r\n• Use aseptic technique to attach the bag to the vaccination device.\r\r\n• For Embrex® Inovoject®, place the vaccine bag in the Intertherm bag with ice packs to provide ongoing chilling during use.\r\r\n \r\r\nIN OVO ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n• Vaccinate using the in ovo route of vaccination in 18- to 19-day-old healthy embryonated chicken eggs only.\r\r\n• Sanitize the in ovo vaccination equipment in accordance with the procedures described in the in ovo vaccination equipment operator’s manual.\r\r\n• Carefully read and follow the in ovo vaccination equipment operator’s manual before initiating vaccination. Failure to follow instructions for in ovo vaccination equipment operation may result in personal injury and/or embryonic morbidity and mortality.\r\r\n• The in ovo vaccination equipment is equipped with an automatic injection system that utilizes a 20-gauge needle and deposits the vaccine about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the egg.\r\r\n• Inject each egg in ovo with 0.05 mL of the vaccine solution.\r\r\n• After diluting, use the vaccine solution within two hours. Do not save any vaccine that has been diluted. Inactivate unused contents before disposal.\r\r\n\r\r\nSUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n• Vaccinate healthy 1-day-old chicks only.\r\r\n• Avoid early exposure of chicks to Marek’s disease virus challenge.\r\r\n• For vaccination, an automatic syringe with 22- to 20-gauge needles, 3/8- to 1/2-inch (0.95 to 1.27 cm) long, is recommended. Make certain that all equipment is sterilized and change needles frequently.\r\r\n• Inject each chick subcutaneously with 0.2 mL of the vaccine.\r\r\n• After diluting, use the vaccine within two hours. Do not save any vaccine that has been diluted. Inactivate all unused contents before disposal. Dispose of all materials in a proper manner.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD\r\r\n21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\n• Store in the vapor or liquid phase of liquid nitrogen.\r\r\n• This product should be stored, transported and administered in accordance with the instructions.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACK SIZES\r\r\n• 5 x 4,000-dose ampules\r\r\n• 5 x 2,000-dose ampules",

Nevertheless, greater secondary problems may result under certain management conditions. Spray vaccination should not be used if intercurrent infection is suspected. It is important to consult your veterinary adviser or Zoetis technical staff before using the spray technique.\r\r\n- Efficacy against infectious bronchitis caused by the 4/91 (793B) UK variant IB strain has not been demonstrated.\r\r\n- Maternally derived antibody (MDA) can interfere with the development of active immunity. Where it is likely that recent field infection or vaccination of the parent flock has stimulated a high antibody titre and consequently a high level of MDA, the timing of the vaccination programme should be planned accordingly.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n» For animals\r\r\nCare should be taken in the planning and implementation of vaccination programmes as vaccine virus may spread from vaccinates to non-vaccinated chickens. It is recommended that all chickens on a site be vaccinated with this product.\r\r\n\r\r\n» For the person\r\r\n- It is recommended to spray vaccinate in a sealed cabinet. Alternatively, the eyes and face of vaccination staff should be protected by a full facemask approved to BS2091 (e.g. a Siebe-Gorman vista type) and eye goggles should be worn. A helmet with filtered air circulation may be used instead of goggles and mask.\r\r\n- On completion operators should wash and disinfect hands in an approved disinfectant.\r\r\n\r\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\r\nA mild vaccination reaction can be observed in the form of transient, slight respiratory symptoms such as occasional sneezing and coughing. No harmful clinical effects have been observed. Tracheal histopathology revealed very low scores in the post vaccination period.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\n- Can be used before the onset of lay in chickens intended for breeding.\r\r\n- The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has been demonstrated when administered during lay.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTION\r\r\nSafety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine, when administered by the spray route to maternal antibody positive chicks, can be administered on the same day as Poulvac NDW and Poulvac SHS. No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product except the products mentioned above. A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\nVaccination scheme:\r\r\n- Broilers: vaccination from first day of life.\r\r\n- Future layers or breeders: vaccination from first day of life or during the 3rd to 4th week of life for immediate protection of young chickens and priming for subsequent vaccinations with an inactivated vaccine.\r\r\n- Layer or breeders: vaccination from onset of lay.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne dose per chicken to be administered with drinking water or by \r\r\nspray. The quantity of water to be used depends on the method of \r\r\nadministration. Never use less than 1 dose per bird.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Drinking water Method\r\r\n- Discontinue any drinking water medication 24 hours before vaccination. Water containing a high level of free chlorine should not be used. A general indication is that if chlorine can be detected in the water by smell or taste it could deactivate the living virus. If so, half a litre (1 pint) of skimmed milk should be thoroughly mixed into every 20 litres (5 gallons) of water or skimmed milk powder added at a rate of two grams per litre of water before adding vaccine.\r\r\n- Only perfectly clean and rust free utensils and drinkers (preferably plastic) should be used, and disinfectants must not be used for cleaning. Ensure that there is enough drinking trough space to allow all birds immediate access to the vaccine. No untreated water should be available until the treated water has been consumed.\r\r\n- Withhold drinking water for 2 hours before vaccination to stimulate thirst. Remove the aluminium seal from the vaccine vial. To dissolve the vaccine pellet, the rubber stopper should then be removed whilst the vial is immersed in a plastic measuring jug containing 1 litre (approximately 1 quart) of clean cool water. Half fill the vial with water, replace the stopper and shake to dissolve any remaining vaccine.\r\r\n- The vaccine concentrate should then be added to and thoroughly mixed with sufficient drinking water to last for approximately 2 hours.\r\r\n- The approximate drinking water requirements for vaccination can be calculated from the age of the birds. Use as many litres of water as the age of the birds in days, per 1000 birds, up to a maximum of 40 litres per 1,000 birds.\r\r\n- Distribute the diluted vaccine evenly in the drinkers. Do not expose prepared drinking water vaccine to sunlight.\r\r\n- Return to regular watering only after the vaccine water has been consumed. The vaccine solution is best divided so that the drinkers are charged at least twice with vaccine to ensure a more widespread uptake.\r\r\n- If nipple drinkers are employed, ensure that header tanks are continually refilled with water containing vaccine.\r\r\n- The vaccine may be used in automatic watering equipment. However, the main supply should only be turned on when all the vaccine treated water has been consumed.\r\r\nNB: Check that birds are never left without water after vaccine treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Spray Method\r\r\n- Poulvac IB primer has been used in most types of spray equipment. The equipment should provide a droplet size of 0.12 to 0.15 mm diameter. The distance from the spraying head to the bird must be approximately 50 cm. Use 0.15 to 0.5 litres of water per 1,000 birds depending upon the type of spray equipment to be used.\r\r\n- The vaccine should be dissolved as described under drinking water administration. The vaccine concentrate should then be added to the water in the sprayer tank and thoroughly mixed.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nA ten-fold overdose administered by eye drop to day-old SPF chicks, observed over 21 days, elicited no effects more severe than those observed with a single dose.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIODS\r\r\nZero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- To stimulate active immunity against infectious bronchitis virus, strain Massachusetts serotype and Dutch variant strains D207/D274.\r\r\n- ATCVet code: QI01AD07\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nDo not use with any other veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF-LIFE\r\r\n- 18 months. \r\r\n- Reconstituted vaccine should be used within 4 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Store and transport refrigerated (2°C - 8°C).\r\r\n- Protect from light.\r\r\n- Do not freeze.\r\r\n\r\r\nNATURE OF PACKAGING\r\r\n- Nature: Type I glass (Ph.Eur) vial\r\r\n- Closure: Butyl rubber (Ph.Eur) and aluminium tear-off cap.\r\r\n- Content: Freeze-dried pellet.\r\r\n- Pack size: Pack of 10 vials containing 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000 doses.",

Contains strains of Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, E. maxima MFP, E. mivati and E. tenella sensitive to anticoccians.\r\r\n\r\r\nFORMULA:\r\r\nEach dose contains:\r\r\n- E. acervulina  600 oocysts min\r\r\n- E. maxima  200 oocysts min\r\r\n- E. maxima  MFP 100 oocysts min\r\r\n- E. mivati  400 oocysts min\r\r\n- E. tenella  200 oocysts min\r\r\n- Vehicle c.b.p  1 dose\r\r\n\r\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\r\nFor the vaccination of healthy day-old chickens, by in-cabin spray administration, as an aid in the prevention of coccidiosis caused by E. mivati and E. tenella, as an aid in the reduction of lesions related to E. acervulina and E. maxima.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE FORM:\r\r\nSuspension.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\n- Oral administration.\r\r\n- The vaccine must be prepared (or mixed) in a ratio of 210 ml of distilled water per 1,000 doses of vaccine. Every 100 chickens should receive 21 ml of vaccine solution, administered by cabin spray, (dye can be used as a marker). Birds must have access to their waste as reinfection is required to induce immunity.\r\r\n\r\r\nVACCINATION PROGRAM:\r\r\nMany factors must be considered in determining the vaccination schedule for a particular farm or poultry operation. For the vaccine to be fully effective, it must be administered to receptive, healthy birds that are in a suitable environment under good management. In addition, the response can be modified by the age of the birds and their immunity status. Normally, a vaccination under field conditions produces complete protection for all individuals, in a given flock. The amount of protection required will vary with the type of operation and the degree of exposure a flock may encounter. For these reasons, a periodic revaccination program may be required.\r\r\n\r\r\nCORRECT ADMINISTRATION:\r\r\n- Avoid contamination.\r\r\n- Shake well before use.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS:\r\r\nDo not vaccinate sick birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nWARNINGS:\r\r\n- It contains gentamicin as a preservative.\r\r\n- Keep out of reach of children and pets.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nFor the person:\r\r\n- Keep the product in its original packaging until it is used to prevent children from having direct access to it.\r\r\n- Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling the product.\r\r\n- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after using the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nFertility and laying:\r\r\n- The safety of the product has not been established for the laying period.\r\r\n\r\r\nInteractions:\r\r\nDo not use with pre-starter or starter foods containing coccidiostats.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Precautions:\r\r\n- Keep between 2 to 7°C protected from light.\r\r\n- Do not freeze.\r\r\n- Once the package is opened, use the entire contents of the bottle.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD:\r\r\nDo not vaccinate during the 21 days prior to the slaughter of the birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRESENTATIONS:\r\r\nBox with 10 vials of 10,000 doses each.",

The onset of immunity has not been established for the mortality claim. \r\r\n- Duration of immunity: 8 weeks after vaccination has been demonstrated for the reduction of lesions and 12 weeks after vaccination for the reduction of mortality.\r\r\n- A cross protection study showed reduction of incidence and severity of airsacculitis caused by E. coli serotypes O1, O2 and O18. For these serotypes no onset of immunity or duration of immunity was established.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\r\n- Only vaccinate healthy birds.\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate animals undergoing antibacterial or immunosuppressive treatment.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL WARNINGS\r\r\n- Do not use antibiotic treatment within 1 week before and after vaccination because antibiotic treatment might impair the efficacy of the vaccine.\r\r\n- No information is available on the influence of high levels of maternally derived antibodies on the efficacy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n• For use in animals\r\r\n- The vaccine strain can be detected in tissues (liver, heart) until 6 days post vaccination. Vaccinated birds may excrete the vaccine strain by faecal route for up to 5 weeks post vaccination, and the vaccine may remain present in the environment until the end of the finishing or rearing period. \r\r\n- Therefore, it is recommended to clean and disinfect bird houses where the vaccine was applied after completion of the finishing or rearing period.\r\r\n- The vaccine strain may spread to in-contact birds.\r\r\n- The vaccine strain can be identified by its growth properties on biological growth media: it shows normal growth on MacConkey and Trypticase Soy Agar, while no colonies are observed when plated without aromatic amino acids (minimum agar).\r\r\n\r\r\n• For the person\r\r\n- Apply the usual aseptic precautions to all administration procedures.\r\r\n- The use of eye-protection, gloves and a nose-mouth mask by the operator is recommended during administration. Immunosuppressed people should not be present during administration of the vaccine. \r\r\n- Disinfect hands and equipment after use.\r\r\n- Personnel involved in attending vaccinated animals should follow general hygiene principals and take particular care in handling litter from recently vaccinated animals.\r\r\n\r\r\nOTHER PRECAUTIONS \r\r\nImmunisation has to be considered as one component in a complex control program that addresses all important hygienic and health factors for poultry.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY, LACTATION OR LAY\r\r\nDo not use in birds in lay, or within 6 weeks before the onset of the laying period.\r\r\n\r\r\nINTERACTION\r\r\nNo information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product. A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» Vaccination schedule\r\r\n- One dose of vaccine from 1 day of age by coarse spray administration.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Administration\r\r\n- Use clean vaccination materials and turn off ventilation until 15 minutes after vaccination.\r\r\n- Remove seal and stopper. Half-fill the bottle with chlorine-free water at room temperature. Replace the stopper and shake well until dissolved. Pour the reconstituted vaccine into a clean container and add chlorine-free water to further dilute the vaccine in order to obtain an even distribution when sprayed onto the birds.\r\r\n- No disinfectants or other substances impairing the performance of the live vaccine should be used in the sprayer.\r\r\n- Dilute and administer the reconstituted vaccine at a rate of one dose of reconstituted vaccine per bird, according to the directions of your specific coarse spray vaccination equipment. The recommended volume for 1 dose is between 0.1 and 0.5 ml. The spraying distance should be between 30 and 80 cm above the animals in order to ensure an even distribution and the recommended droplet size is greater than 100 µm. \r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE\r\r\nNo adverse reactions have been observed after the administration of a 10 fold overdose of the vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHDRAWAL PERIOD(S)\r\r\nZero days.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: live bacterial vaccines – Escherichia.\r\r\n- ATCvet code: QI01AE04.\r\r\n- To stimulate active immunity to Escherichia coli serotype O78.\r\r\n\r\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\r\nDo not mix with any other veterinary medicinal product.\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As package for sale: 18 months.\r\r\n- After reconstitution: 2 hours.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\n- Keep the bottle in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\r\r\n- Store and transport refrigerated (2°C – 8°C).

The vaccine ampules are inserted in metal canes, stored and shipped in a liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nInnovax-ILT® is recommended for vaccination of 18-day-old chicken embryos by in ovo administration and of healthy one-day-old chickens by the subcutaneous route as an aid in the prevention of Marek’s Disease and Infectious Laryngotracheitis.\r\r\n\r\r\nVACCINE PREPARATION\r\r\nCAUTION:\r\r\n- READ ABOVE WARNING ADVICE ON HANDLING VACCINE AMPULE.\r\r\n- AMPULES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EXPLODE ON SUDDEN TEMPERATURE CHANGES.\r\r\n- DO NOT THAW IN HOT OR ICE COLD WATER.\r\r\n- STERILIZE VACCINATING EQUIPMENT BY BOILING IN WATER FOR 30 MINUTES OR BY AUTOCLAVING 20 MINUTES AT 250°F (121°C).\r\r\n- DO NOT USE CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS.\r\r\n\r\r\n• Before withdrawing vaccine from liquid nitrogen canister, protect hands with gloves, wear long sleeves and use a facemask or goggles. It is possible an accident could occur with either the liquid nitrogen or the ampules of vaccine. When removing an ampule from the cane, hold palm of gloved hand away from body and face.\r\r\n• When withdrawing a cane of ampules from canister in liquid nitrogen container, expose only the ampule to be used immediately. We recommend handling only one ampule at a time. After removing the ampule from the cane, the remaining ampules should be replaced immediately in the canister of the liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n• The contents of the ampule are thawed rapidly by immersing in a container of clean water at a temperature range of 68°-86°F (20°-30°C). Gently swirl the ampule to disperse contents. Then break ampule at its neck and immediately proceed as below.\r\r\n• Dilute the vaccine for administration using 200 ml diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.2 ml per chicken by the subcutaneous route.\r\r\n• Draw contents of ampule into a sterile 10 ml syringe, mounted with an 18 gauge needle.\r\r\n• Dilute immediately by filling the syringe slowly with a portion of the diluent. IMPORTANT: THE DILUENT SHOULD BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE (60°-80°F/ 16°-27°C) AT TIME OF MIXING.\r\r\n• The contents of the filled syringe are then added to remaining diluent. It is important that this be done slowly. Slowly empty the syringe, allowing the vaccine to run down the side of the diluent container. Gently agitate the container as the vaccine is being mixed. Withdraw a portion of the diluent with the syringe to flush ampule. Remove the remaining diluent from the ampule and inject gently into the diluent container. Remove the syringe.\r\r\n• Fill the previously sterilized automatic syringe according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\r\r\n• The vaccine is now ready for use.\r\r\n\r\r\nMETHOD OF VACCINATION\r\r\nSubcutaneous Administration:\r\r\n• Hold the chicken by the back of the neck just below the head. The loose skin in the area is raised by gently pinching with the thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle beneath the skin in a downward direction away from the head. Inject 0.2 ml per chicken.\r\r\n• Avoid hitting the muscles and bones in the neck.\r\r\n• Entire contents of container must be used within 1 hour after mixing or be discarded.\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION\r\r\nGood management practices are recommended to reduce exposure to Marek’s disease for at least three weeks following vaccination. Therefore, directions should be followed carefully.\r\r\n• Do not mix any substance with this vaccine.\r\r\n• Store vaccine in liquid nitrogen at a temperature below -238°F (-150°C).\r\r\n• Gloves and visor should be worn when handling liquid nitrogen.\r\r\n• ONCE THAWED, THE PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE REFROZEN.\r\r\n• Do not dilute or otherwise stretch the dosage of this vaccine.\r\r\n• Once mixed with diluent, the vaccine should be gently agitated frequently.\r\r\n• Once mixed with diluent, the vaccine should be used within 1 hour.\r\r\n• Only healthy chickens should be vaccinated.\r\r\n• Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n• This vaccine contains Gentamicin as a preservative.\r\r\n• BURN THIS CONTAINER AND ALL UNUSED CONTENTS.\r\r\n• FOR VETERINARY USE ONLY.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECORDS\r\r\nKeep a record of vaccine, quantity, serial number, expiration date, and place of purchase; the date and time of vaccination; the number, age, breed, and locations of chickens; names of operators performing the vaccination and any observed reactions.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\n• AMPULES – Store in liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n• DILUENT – Store at room temperature.\r\r\n• CONTAINER – Store liquid nitrogen container securely in upright position in a dry, well-ventilated area and away from incubator intakes and chicken boxes.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Liquid nitrogen container and vaccine should be handled only by properly trained personnel who are thoroughly conversant with the Union Carbide publication and instruction booklet regarding the use of, precautions and safe practices for liquefied atmospheric gases (particularly liquid nitrogen).\r\r\n- When removing ampule cane, handling frozen ampules, or adding liquid nitrogen, wear long sleeves, a plastic face shield and gloves to protect the skin from contact with the liquid nitrogen. All storage and handling of the liquid nitrogen container must be in a dry, ventilated area. Do not inhale liquid nitrogen vapors. If drowsiness occurs, get fresh air quickly; then ventilate entire area. If breathing difficulty occurs, apply artificial respiration. If any of these difficulties persist or there is a loss of consciousness, summon a physician immediately.\r\r\n- Care should be exercised to prevent contaminating your hands, eyes and clothing with the vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nHOW SUPPLIED\r\r\nPackaging 2,000 Dose Ampule 200 ml of Sterile Diluent per 1,000 Doses",

The vials should be opened under water. The spray apparatus should be free from sediments, corrosion and traces of disinfectants (preferably used for vaccination purpose only). The vaccine medicated water should be sprayed evenly over the correct number of birds, at a distance of 30 to 40 cm, preferably when the birds are sitting together in dim light. For day old chicks use 0.25 liter for 1000 birds and for older birds use 0.5 liter for 1000 birds and set the nozzle to produce a coarse spray.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Intranasal / intraocular instillation\r\r\n• Dissolve the vaccine in physiological saline solution (usually 30 ml per 1000 doses) and administer by means of a standardised dropper. One drop should be applied from a height of a few centimetres into one nostril or one eye. The handler should ensure that the nasal drop is inhaled by the bird.\r\r\n• Note: For intranasal / intraocular administration a special diluent, Diluent\r\r\n• Oculo Nasal is available.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Drinking water\r\r\n• The vials should be opened under water. Use cool, clean water which is free of iron and chlorine. By adding 2 gm skimmed milk powder per litre of water the virus retains its activity much longer. Ensure uptake of all the vaccinemedicated water in 2 hours. Depending on the weather conditions, it may be advisable to deprive the birds of water prior to vaccination. A sufficient number of water containers to provide adequate drinking space is essential. These should be clean and free from traces of detergents and disinfectants. Dissolve 1000 doses in as many litres of water as the age of the birds in days, to a maximum of 40 litres. The vaccine should be given in the early morning as this is the main period for drinking or the cool period on a hot day. When vaccinating larger flocks, it is advisable to start by dissolving only part of the vaccine. If vaccine is administered through a central water supply or a proportioner, great care should be taken. For numbers of birds between standard dosages, the next higher dosage should be chosen.\r\r\n• Note: Administration by coarse spray or the oculo-nasal route gives the best response. These should be the methods of choice, especially when vaccinating young birds.\r\r\n\r\r\nCONTRA-INDICATIONS\r\r\nWhen used according to instructions: None.\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n• Reconstituted vaccine should be used within two hours.\r\r\n• Use of the vaccine can cause temporary conjunctivitis in the operator.\r\r\n• Avoid exposure to the vaccine virus as much as possible (e.g. by wearing a face mask).\r\r\n• The vaccine viruses spread readily to contact chickens.\r\r\n• Dispose of empty or part-used vials in accordance with local regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n• Vaccinate healthy birds only.\r\r\n• Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccinating.\r\r\n• Each vial should be used immediately after opening.\r\r\n\r\r\nWITHHOLDING PERIOD\r\r\nNone\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\nStore at a temperature of 2-8°C in the dark.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRESENTATION\r\r\nBoxes of vials each containing 1000 or 2500 doses.",

In addition, the response may be modified by the age of the birds and their immune status. Seldom does 1 vaccination under field conditions produce complete protection for all individuals in a given flock. The amount of protection required will vary with the type of operation and the degree of exposure that a flock is likely to encounter. \r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Only vaccinate healthy birds.\r\r\n- This product is not ordinarily recommended for use with prestarter or starter feeds containing coccidiostats.\r\r\n- Birds must have access to their droppings as reinfection is required to induce immunity.\r\r\n- Do not freeze.\r\r\n- Burn containers and all unused contents.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPRAY CABINET ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» For chickens 1 day of age:\r\r\nThe vaccine should be prepared (or mixed) at the rate of 210 ml of distilled water per 1000 doses of vaccine. Each 100 chicks should receive 21 ml of vaccine solution. (Dye may be added as a marker).\r\r\n\r\r\nFEED SPRAY ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n» For chickens 4 days of age:\r\r\n1. Do not use any medicated drinking water or water disinfectant 24 hours before and after vaccination or during vaccination.\r\r\n2. Feed sprinkled on paper under the feed line increases the exposure of chicks to the vaccine.\r\r\n3. Dilute the vaccine at a ratio of 1000 doses/400 ml of non-chlorinated water. Mix well and place in a clean garden type pressure sprayer.\r\r\n4. Spray the diluted vaccine over the surface of the feed. Agitate the sprayer during administration.\r\r\n5. For best results, the vaccine should be sprayed on all of the feed.\r\r\n6. Avoid wetting the feed. Proper application will only dampen the surface of the feed.\r\r\n7. Allow the chicks sufficient time to ingest the oocysts on the feed before placing more feed in the pans or on the paper.\r\r\n\r\r\nFARTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- Use entire contents when first opened.\r\r\n- Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n- Store vaccine in refrigerator 35° to 45°F (2° to 7°C).\r\r\n- Gentamicin is added as a preservative.",

        "description": "DESCRIPTION\r\r\nThis vaccine is a frozen, cell associated, live virus vaccine that contains the recombinant serotype 3 turkey herpesvirus with genes (gD & gI) from infectious laryngotracheitis virus and with the VP2 gene from infectious bursal disease virus. The vaccine is packaged in glass ampules and supplied with diluent packaged in a separate container. The vaccine ampules are inserted in metal canes, stored and shipped in a liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nThis product has been shown to be effective for the vaccination of healthy 18-day-old chicken embryos, or one-day-old chickens, against Marek’s disease, infectious laryngotracheitis and standard infectious bursal disease. Duration of immunity has not been established.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nLiquid nitrogen container and vaccine should be handled only by properly trained personnel regarding the use of, precautions and safe practices for liquefied atmospheric gases (particularly liquid nitrogen). When removing ampule cane, handling frozen ampules, or adding liquid nitrogen, wear long sleeves, a plastic face shield and gloves to protect the skin from contact with the liquid nitrogen. All storage and handling of the liquid nitrogen container must be in a dry, ventilated area. Do not inhale liquid nitrogen vapors. If drowsiness occurs, get fresh air quickly; then ventilate entire area. If breathing difficulty occurs, apply artificial respiration. If any of these difficulties persist or there is a loss of consciousness, summon a physician immediately. Care should be exercised to prevent contaminating your hands, eyes and clothing with the vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREPARATION OF VACCINE\r\r\nCAUTION:\r\r\n- READ ABOVE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ON HANDLING VACCINE \r\r\nAMPULE.\r\r\n- AMPULES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EXPLODE ON SUDDEN \r\r\nTEMPERATURE CHANGES.\r\r\n- DO NOT THAW IN HOT OR ICE COLD WATER.\r\r\n1. Before withdrawing vaccine from liquid nitrogen canister, protect hands with gloves, wear long sleeves and use a facemask or goggles. It is possible an accident could occur with either the liquid nitrogen or the ampules of vaccine. When removing an ampule from the cane, hold palm of gloved hand away from body and face.\r\r\n2. When withdrawing a cane of ampules from canister in liquid nitrogen container, expose only the ampules to be used immediately. We recommend handling a maximum of 4 ampules at a time. The remaining ampules should be replaced immediately in the canister of the liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n3. The contents of the ampule are thawed rapidly by immersing in a container of clean water at a temperature range of 20-30°C (68-86°F). Once the vaccine has thawed remove ampule from water bath. Gently swirl the ampule to disperse contents. Then break ampule at its neck and immediately proceed as below.\r\r\n4. Dilute the vaccine for administration. Use 100 ml sterile diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.1 ml dose per chicken embryo or use 50 ml for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.05 ml per chicken embryo by the in ovo route. Use 200 ml sterile diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.2 ml dose per chicken by the subcutaneous route.\r\r\n5. Draw contents of ampule into a sterile 10 ml syringe, mounted with an 18 gauge needle.\r\r\n6. Dilute immediately by filling the syringe slowly with a portion of the diluent.\r\r\nIMPORTANT: THE DILUENT SHOULD BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 16-27°C(60-80°F) AT TIME OF MIXING.\r\r\n7. Slowly empty the syringe into the prepared diluent bag. Withdraw a portion of the diluent with the syringe to rinse ampule. Remove the remaining diluent from the ampule and inject gently into the diluent bag. Mix gently.\r\r\n8. Fill the previously sterilized automatic syringe or egg inoculation machine according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\r\r\n9. The vaccine is now ready for use.\r\r\n\r\r\nMETHOD OF VACCINATION\r\r\n1. For in ovo administration: inoculate each 18-day-old chicken embryo with a full dose (0.05 ml or 0.1 ml). For subcutaneous administration: inoculate each day-old chicken with a full dose (0.2 ml).\r\r\n2. Use entire contents of diluent bag within 1 hour after mixing.\r\r\n3. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be kept cool and gently agitated frequently.\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION\r\r\n1. VACCINATE ONLY HEALTHY CHICKENS AND CHICKEN EMBRYOS.\r\r\n2. Do not mix with other products, except as specified on this label.\r\r\n3. Store vaccine in liquid nitrogen at a temperature below -150°C (-238°F).\r\r\n4. ONCE THAWED, THE PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE REFROZEN.\r\r\n5. Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n6. Contains gentamicin as a preservative.\r\r\n7. Inactivate unused contents before disposal.\r\r\n8. In case of human exposure, contact a physician.\r\r\n9. FOR ANIMAL USE ONLY.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECORDS\r\r\nKeep a record of vaccine, quantity, serial number, expiration date, and place of purchase; the date and time of vaccination; the number, age, breed, and locations of chickens; names of operators performing the vaccination and any observed reactions.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS\r\r\n- AMPULES: Store in liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n- DILUENT: Do not freeze.\r\r\n- CONTAINER: Store liquid nitrogen container securely in upright position in a dry, well ventilated area and away from incubator intakes and chicken boxes.\r\r\n\r\r\nPACKAGE\r\r\n2,000 dose ampules\r\r\n4,000 dose ampules",

        "description": "DESCRIPTION\r\r\nThis vaccine is a frozen, cell associated, live virus vaccine that contains the recombinant serotype 3 turkey herpesvirus with the F gene from Newcastle disease virus and with genes from laryngotracheitis virus. The vaccine is packaged in glass ampules and supplied with diluent packaged in a separate container. The vaccine ampules are inserted in metal canes, stored and shipped in a liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n\r\r\nINDICATIONS\r\r\nThis product has been shown to be effective for the vaccination of healthy 18 day old chicken embryos or one day old chickens against Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease and infectious laryngotracheitis. Duration of Immunity has not been established. For more information regarding efficacy and safety data, go to productdata.aphis.usda.gov.\r\r\n\r\r\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nLiquid nitrogen container and vaccine should be handled only by properly  trained personnel who are thoroughly conversant with the Union Carbide  publication and instruction booklet regarding the use of, precautions and safe  practices for liquefied atmospheric gases (particularly liquid nitrogen). When removing ampule cane, handling frozen ampules, or adding liquid nitrogen,  wear long sleeves, a plastic face shield and gloves to protect the skin from contact with the liquid nitrogen. All storage and handling of the liquid nitrogen  container must be in a dry, ventilated area. Do not inhale liquid nitrogen vapors.  If drowsiness occurs, get fresh air quickly; then ventilate entire area. If breathing  difficulty occurs, apply artificial respiration. If any of these difficulties persist or there is a loss of consciousness, summon a physician immediately. Care should be exercised to prevent contaminating your hands, eyes and clothing with the vaccine.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREPARATION OF VACCINE\r\r\nCAUTION:\r\r\n- READ ABOVE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ON HANDLING VACCINE AMPULE.\r\r\n- AMPULES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EXPLODE ON SUDDEN TEMPERATURE CHANGES.\r\r\n- DO NOT THAW IN HOT OR ICE COLD WATER.\r\r\n- STERILIZE VACCINATING EQUIPMENT BY BOILING IN WATER FOR 30 MINUTES OR BY AUTOCLAVING 20 MINUTES AT 121°C (250°F).\r\r\n- DO NOT USE CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Before withdrawing vaccine from liquid nitrogen canister, protect hands with gloves, wear long sleeves and use a facemask or goggles. It is possible an accident could occur with either the liquid nitrogen or the ampules of vaccine. When removing an ampule from the cane, hold palm of gloved hand away from body and face.\r\r\n2. When withdrawing a cane of ampules from canister in liquid nitrogen container, expose only the ampule to be used immediately. We recommend handling only one ampule at a time. After removing the ampule from the cane, the remaining ampules should be replaced immediately in the canister of the liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n3. The contents of the ampule are thawed rapidly by immersing in a container of clean water at a temperature range of 20-30°C (68-86°F). Gently swirl the ampule to disperse contents. Then break ampule at its neck and immediately proceed as below.\r\r\n4. Dilute the vaccine for administration. Use 100 ml sterile diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.1 ml dose per chicken embryo or use 50 ml for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.05 ml per chicken embryo by the in ovo route. Use 200 ml sterile diluent for each 1,000 doses of vaccine to administer 0.2 ml dose per chicken by the subcutaneous route.\r\r\n5. Draw contents of ampule into a sterile 10 ml syringe, mounted with an 18 gauge needle.\r\r\n6. Dilute immediately by filling the syringe slowly with a portion of the diluent.\r\r\nIMPORTANT: THE DILUENT SHOULD BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 16-27°C(60-80°F) AT TIME OF MIXING.\r\r\n7. The contents of the filled syringe are then added to remaining diluent. It is important that this be done slowly. Slowly empty the syringe, allowing the vaccine to run down the side of the diluent container. Gently agitate the container as the vaccine is being mixed. Withdraw a portion of the diluent with the syringe to flush ampule. Remove the remaining diluent from the ampule and inject gently into the diluent container. Remove the syringe.\r\r\n8. Fill the previously sterilized automatic syringe or egg inoculation machine according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\r\r\n9. The vaccine is now ready for use.\r\r\n\r\r\nMETHOD OF VACCINATION\r\r\n» In ovo Administration:\r\r\n1. Inoculate each 18 day old chicken embryo with a full dose (0.05 ml or 0.1 ml).\r\r\n2. Entire contents of container must be used within 1 hour after mixing or be discarded.\r\r\n3. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be kept cool and gently agitated frequently.\r\r\n\r\r\n» Subcutaneous Administration:\r\r\n1. Hold the chicken by the back of the neck just below the head. The loose skin in the area is raised by gently pinching with the thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle beneath the skin in a downward direction away from the head. Inject 0.2 ml per chicken.\r\r\n2. Avoid hitting the muscles and bones in the neck.\r\r\n3. Entire contents of container must be used within 1 hour after mixing or be discarded.\r\r\n\r\r\nCAUTION\r\r\nGood management practices are recommended to reduce exposure to Marek’s disease and infectious laryngotracheitis for at least three weeks following vaccination. Therefore, directions should be followed carefully.\r\r\n1. Do not mix any substance with this vaccine. Do not mix with other products, except as specified on this label.\r\r\n2. Store vaccine in liquid nitrogen at a temperature below -150°C (-238°F).\r\r\n3. Gloves and visor should be worn when handling liquid nitrogen.\r\r\n4. ONCE THAWED, THE PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE REFROZEN.\r\r\n5. Do not dilute or otherwise stretch the dosage of this vaccine.\r\r\n6. Once mixed with diluent, the vaccine should be gently agitated frequently.\r\r\n7. Once mixed with diluent, the vaccine should be used within 1 hour.\r\r\n8. Only healthy chicken embryos should be vaccinated.\r\r\n9. Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.\r\r\n10. This vaccine contains Gentamicin as a preservative.\r\r\n11. Inactivate unused contents before disposal.\r\r\n12. In case of human exposure, contact a physician.\r\r\n13. FOR ANIMAL USE ONLY.\r\r\n\r\r\nRECORDS\r\r\nKeep a record of vaccine, quantity, serial number, expiration date, and place of purchase; the date and time of vaccination; the number, age, breed, and locations of chickens; names of operators performing the vaccination and any observed reactions.\r\r\n\r\r\nStorage Conditions\r\r\n- AMPULES: Store in liquid nitrogen container.\r\r\n- DILUENT: Do not freeze.\r\r\n- CONTAINER: Store liquid nitrogen container securely in upright position in a dry, well ventilated area and away from incubator intakes and chicken boxes.",

The success of vaccination, depends on correct storage and application of the vaccine, hereditary factors, age, present diseases, titer of maternal antibodies, feeding, stressors as well as the simultaneous use of other products. Before vaccinating your flock, it is good to consult with experts in poultry diseases, because immunization programs differ depending on the epizootic area. It is especially important that the chickens are kept and fed properly in the period after vaccination. Only healthy animals may be vaccinated.\r\r\n\r\r\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS\r\r\nThe vaccine strain of virus can spread to susceptible unvaccinated chickens for at least 10 days after vaccination.\r\r\n\r\r\nPREGNANCY OR LAYING\r\r\nThe vaccine is not administered to laying hens.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOSAGE AND APPLICATION\r\r\n- The vaccine is administered in drinking water. The lyophilisate should be dissolved (resuspended) in clean, cold water, without traces of chlorine or other disinfectants.\r\r\n- 1000 doses of the vaccine are resuspended in 10 liters of water.\r\r\n- Chickens are deprived of drinking water for 3 hours before immunization. There must be enough space, i.e. about 30% more than required for that age, so that all chickens can drink the water with the vaccine within one hour.\r\r\n- It is recommended to vaccinate chicks at the age of 10-20 days, i.e. depending on the level of maternal antibodies. A single vaccination, as a rule, ensures a sufficient level of protection against infection with the infectious bursa of fabricius virus (Gumboro disease).\r\r\n- In unfavorable epizootiological circumstances, and in flocks with uneven titers of antibodies, it is recommended to vaccinate chickens twice, the first time at the age of 8-12 days and again at the age of 18-20 days.\r\r\n\r\r\nOVERDOSE \r\r\n10 times higher than the recommended dose does not cause adverse effects.\r\r\n\r\r\nIMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\r\r\n- Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunological preparations for birds, domestic poultry, live virus vaccines, infectious bursal disease virus (Gumboro disease), ATCvet code: Q10 LAD09\r\r\n- In chickens, the vaccine GUMBOKAL IM SPF stimulates the formation of specific antibodies against the virus of the bursa of fabricius disease (Gumboro disease).\r\r\n\r\r\nSHELF LIFE\r\r\n- As packaged for sale: 2 years\r\r\n- After resuspension: 3 hours\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS \r\r\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C-8°C).

As a result of this, the virus is capable of breaking through the maternal immunity at an earlier stage and will spread better through the vaccinated flock. The age at which chickens can be successfully vaccinated depends on the level of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) and therefore on the type of birds and on the way the parent breeding flock is vaccinated.\r\r\n\r\r\nGUIDELINE\r\r\n- Broilers derived from parent flocks vaccinated with live Gumboro vaccines only, can be vaccinated from day 7-14.\r\r\n- Broilers derived from parent flocks vaccinated with inactivated Gumboro vaccines, can be vaccinated from day 14-17.\r\r\n- The vaccination of future laying stock derived from parent flocks vaccinated with live Gumboro vaccines only, can be carried out from day 14-21.\r\r\n- The vaccination of future laying stock derived from parent flocks vaccinated with inactivated Gumboro vaccines, should be carried out from day 21-28.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe above scheme is based on the fact that during these periods the MDA levels in that particular progeny have decreased sufficiently (e.g. log2 VN titre between approximately 7.0 and 8.5) to be able to vaccinate them successfully with Nobilis Gumboro 228E but are still high enough to protect them against infection with circulating field virus.\r\r\n\r\r\nMETHOD OF ADMINISTRATION\r\r\n- Via the drinking water.\r\r\n- The vials should be opened under water. Use cool, clean water which is free of iron and chlorine. By adding 2 gram skimmed milk powder per litre of water the virus retains its activity much longer. Ensure uptake of all the vaccine-medicated water in 2 hours. Depending on the weather conditions, it may be advisable to deprive the birds of water prior to vaccination. A sufficient number of water containers to provide adequate drinking space is essential. These should be clean and free from traces of detergents and disinfectants. Dissolve 1000 doses in as many litres of water as the age of the birds in days, to a maximum of 40 litres. The vaccine should be given in the early morning as this is the main period for drinking or the cool period on a hot day. When vaccinating larger flocks, it is advisable to begin by dissolving only part of the vaccine. If vaccine is administered through a central water supply or a proportioner, great care should be taken. For numbers of birds between standard dosages, the next higher dosage should be chosen.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRESENTATION\r\r\nVials each containing 1000 or 2500 doses in packs of 10 vials.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTORAGE\r\r\nStore at a temperature of 2-8°C in the dark.\r\r\n\r\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION\r\r\n- Do not combine with other vaccines unless specified on leaflet.\r\r\n- Dispose of empty or part-used vials in accordance with local regulations.\r\r\n\r\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\r\n- Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccination.\r\r\n- Vaccinate healthy birds only.\r\r\n- Each vial should be used immediately after opening.",
